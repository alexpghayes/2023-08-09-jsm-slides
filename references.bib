  abstract = {Consider data consisting of pairwise measurements, such as presence or absence of links between pairs of objects. These data arise, for instance, in the analysis of protein interactions and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing pairwise measurements with probabilistic models requires special assumptions, since the usual independence or exchangeability assumptions no longer hold. Here we introduce a class of variance allocation models for pairwise measurements: mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. These models combine global parameters that instantiate dense patches of connectivity (blockmodel) with local parameters that instantiate node-specific variability in the connections (mixed membership). We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We demonstrate the advantages of mixed membership stochastic blockmodels with applications to social networks and protein interaction networks.},

Normalizing the data by filtering out the eigengenes (and eigenarrays) that are inferred to represent noise or experimental artifacts enables meaningful comparison of the expression of different genes across different arrays in different experiments. Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively. After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

Ignoring treatment interference can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects and incorrect statistical inferences. Some recent studies have started to incorporate treatment interference into causal inference. But treatment interference is often assumed to follow a simple structure (e.g., treatment interference exists only within groups) or measured in a simplistic way (e.g., only based on the number of treated friends). In this paper, I highlight the importance of collecting data on actual treatment diffusion in order to more accurately measure treatment interference. Furthermore, I show that with accurate measures of treatment interference, we can identify and estimate a series of causal effects that are previously unavailable, including the direct treatment effect, treatment interference effect, and treatment effect on interference. I illustrate the methods through a case study of a social network\textendash based smoking prevention intervention.},

  abstract = {In this article, I present a new multivariate regression model for analyzing outcomes with network dependence. The model is capable to account for two types of outcome dependence including the mean dependence that allows the outcome to depend on selected features of a known dependence network and the error dependence that allows the outcome to be additionally correlated based on patterned connections in the dependence network (e.g., according to whether the ties are asymmetric, mutual, or triadic). For example, when predicting a group of students' smoking status, the outcome can depend on the students' positions in their friendship network and also be correlated among friends. I show that analyses ignoring the mean dependence can lead to severe bias in the estimated coefficients while analyses ignoring the error dependence can lead to inefficient inferences and failures in recognizing unmeasured social processes. I compare the new model with related models such as multilevel models, spatial regression models, and exponential random graph models and show their connections and differences. I propose a two-step, feasible generalized least squares estimator to estimate the model that is computationally fast and robust. Simulations show the validity of the new model (and the estimator) while four empirical examples demonstrate its versatility. Associated R package ``fglsnet'' is available for public use.},

Synthesizing what is known about the cross-world independence assumption, we discuss the relationship between assumptions for causal mediation analyses, causal models, and non-parametric identification of natural direct and indirect effects. In particular, we give a practical example of an applied setting where the cross-world independence assumption is violated even without any post-treatment confounding. Further, we review possible alternatives to the cross-world independence assumption, including the use of bounds that avoid the assumption altogether. Finally, we carry out a numerical study in which the cross-world independence assumption is violated to assess the ensuing bias in estimating natural direct and indirect effects. We conclude with recommendations for carrying out causal mediation analyses.},

It presents a meta-analysis (n = 334,567, k = 462) of the correlations of Big Five and HEXACO personality domains with the dimensions of SWB and PWB. It provides the first meta-analysis of personality and well-being to examine (a) HEXACO personality, (b) PWB dimensions, and (c) a broad range of established Big Five measures. It also provides the first robust synthesis of facet-level correlations and incremental prediction by facets over domains in relation to SWB and PWB using four large datasets comprising data from prominent, long-form hierarchical personality frameworks: NEO PI-R (n = 1,673), IPIP-NEO (n = 903), HEXACO PIR (n = 465), and Big Five Aspect Scales (n = 706). Meta-analytic results highlighted the importance of Big Five neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. The pattern of correlations between Big Five personality and SWB was similar across personality measures (e.g., BFI, NEO, IPIP, BFAS, Adjectives). In the HEXACO model, extraversion was the strongest wellbeing correlate. Facet-level analyses provided a richer description of the relationship between personality and well-being, and clarified differences between the two trait frameworks. Prediction by facets was typically around 20\% better than domains, and this incremental prediction was larger for some well-being dimensions than others.},

As an information-theoretic benchmark, we study data sets generated by a dynamic stochastic block model, and derive fundamental information criteria for the recoverability of the community memberships as N \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} both for bounded and diverging T . These results show that (i) even a small increase in T may have a big impact on the recoverability of community memberships, (ii) consistent recovery is possible even for very sparse data (e.g. bounded average degree) when T is large enough. We analyse the accuracy of the proposed estimation algorithms under various assumptions on data sparsity and identifiability, and prove that an efficient online algorithm is strongly consistent up to the information-theoretic threshold under suitable initialisation. Numerical experiments show that even a poor initial estimate (e.g., blind random guess) of the community assignment leads to high accuracy after a small number of iterations, and remarkably so also in very sparse regimes.},

  abstract = {Randomized experiments on a network often involve interference between connected units, namely, a situation in which an individual's treatment can affect the response of another individual. Current approaches to deal with interference, in theory and in practice, often make restrictive assumptions on its structure\textemdash for instance, assuming that interference is local\textemdash even when using otherwise nonparametric inference strategies. This reliance on explicit restrictions on the interference mechanism suggests a shared intuition that inference is impossible without any assumptions on the interference structure. In this paper, we begin by formalizing this intuition in the context of a classical nonparametric approach to inference, referred to as design-based inference of causal effects. Next, we show how, always in the context of design-based inference, even parametric structural assumptions that allow the existence of unbiased estimators cannot guarantee a decreasing variance even in the large sample limit. This lack of concentration in large samples is often observed empirically, in randomized experiments in which interference of some form is expected to be present. This result has direct consequences for the design and analysis of large experiments\textemdash for instance, in online social platforms\textemdash where the belief is that large sample sizes automatically guarantee small variance. More broadly, our results suggest that although strategies for causal inference in the presence of interference borrow their formalism and main concepts from the traditional causal inference literature, much of the intuition from the no-interference case do not easily transfer to the interference setting.},

We use these models to develop restricted randomization strategies for allocating treatment optimally, by minimizing the mean squared error of the estimated average treatment effect. Analytical decompositions of the mean squared error, due both to the model and to the randomization distribution, provide insights into aspects of the optimal designs. In particular, the analysis suggests new notions of balance based on specific network quantities, in addition to classical covariate balance. The resulting balanced optimal restricted randomization strategies are still design-unbiased when the model used to derive them does not hold. We illustrate how the proposed treatment allocation strategies improve on allocations that ignore the network structure.},

Methods for estimating causal effects have been developed in the setting where the structure of dependence between units is known exactly [10, 36, 20], but in practice there is often substantial uncertainty about the precise network structure. This is true, for example, in trial data drawn from vulnerable communities where social ties are difficult to query directly. In this paper we combine techniques from the structure learning and interference literatures in causal inference, proposing a general method for estimating causal effects under data dependence when the structure of this dependence is not known a priori.

We utilize these node covariates to help uncover latent communities in a graph, using a modification of spectral clustering. Statistical guarantees are provided under a joint mixture model that we call the node-contextualized stochastic blockmodel, including a bound on the misclustering rate. The bound is used to derive conditions for achieving perfect clustering. For most simulated cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields results superior both to regularized spectral clustering without node covariates and to an adaptation of canonical correlation analysis. We apply our clustering method to large brain graphs derived from diffusion MRI data, using the node locations or neurological region membership as covariates. In both cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields clusters that are easier to interpret neurologically.},

Then cos 6k and sin Okare computed as the singular values of certain related matrices. Experimental results are given, which indicates that MGS gives ok with equal precision and fewer arithmetic operations than HT. However, HT gives principal vectors, which are orthogonal to working accuracy, which is not generally true for MGS. Finally, the case when A and/or B are rank deficient is discussed.},

Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between `close friends' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.},

To understand large-scale structure in a network, a common task is to cluster a network's nodes into sets called ``communities'', such that there are dense connections within communities but sparse connections between them. A popular and statistically principled method to perform such clustering is to use a family of generative models known as stochastic block models (SBMs). In this paper, we show that maximum likelihood estimation in an SBM is a network analog of a well-known continuum surface-tension problem that arises from an application in metallurgy. To illustrate the utility of this relationship, we implement network analogs of three surface-tension algorithms, with which we successfully recover planted community structure in synthetic networks and which yield fascinating insights on empirical networks that we construct from hyperspectral videos.},

We show that endogenous and exogenous effects are generally identified under network interaction, although identification may fail for some particular structures.

Monte Carlo simulations calibrated on this application provide an analysis of the effects of some crucial characteristics of a network (i.e., density, intransitivity) on the estimates of peer effects.

This estimator is known to be ``heteroskedasticity-consistent,'' but it is less well known to be ``nonlinearity-consistent'' as well. Nonlinearity, however, raises fundamental issues because in its presence regressors are not ancillary, hence cannot be treated as fixed. The consequences are deep: (1) population slopes need to be reinterpreted as statistical functionals obtained from OLS fits to largely arbitrary joint x-y distributions; (2) the meaning of slope parameters needs to be rethought; (3) the regressor distribution affects the slope parameters; (4) randomness of the regres{$\surd$}sors becomes a source of sampling variability in slope estimates of order 1/ N; (5) inference needs to be based on model-robust standard errors, including sandwich estimators or the x-y bootstrap. In theory, model-robust and model-trusting standard errors can deviate by arbitrary magnitudes either way. In practice, significant deviations between them can be detected with a diagnostic test.},

In empirical studies, researchers often adopt a two-stage procedure to first estimate the centrality and then infer the network effect using the estimated centrality. Despite its prevalent adoption, this two-stage procedure lacks theoretical backing and can fail in both estimation and inference. We, therefore, propose a unified framework, under which we prove the shortcomings of the two-stage in centrality estimation and the undesirable consequences in the regression. We then propose a novel supervised network centrality estimation (SuperCENT) methodology that simultaneously yields superior estimations of the centrality and the network effect and provides valid and narrower confidence intervals than those from the twostage. We showcase the superiority of SuperCENT in predicting the currency risk premium based on the global trade network.},

Focusing on the role of beliefs about returns to study effort, we see that short term study effort greatly increased for those students who originally over-estimated their returns to study effort. In contrast, we find more long term effects for students who originally under-estimated the returns to study effort. These students outperformed students who had over-estimated the returns to study effort both on measures of exam performance as well as overall course performance. We also see strong evidence that low-income students increased their study effort through out the course, along with evidence of large effects on their exam and course performance.

To distinguish the effect of peers from confounding factors, we exploit the population variation in the proportion of children from families linked to domestic violence, who have been shown to disrupt contemporaneous behavior and learning. Results show that exposure to a disruptive peer in classes of 25 during elementary school reduces earnings at age 24 to 28 by 3 percent. We estimate that differential exposure to children linked to domestic violence explains 5 percent of the rich-poor earnings gap in our data, and that each year of exposure to a disruptive peer reduces the present discounted value of classmates' future earnings by \$80,000.

Results from the pilot show that students in the treatment group scored higher on exams, homework assignments, and final course grade.

Specifically, the approach first utilizes scalable network representation learning algorithms to obtain node embeddings, which are extracted from social network structures. Then, the embeddings are used to control latent homophily in a quasi-experimental design for causal inference. The simulation experiments show that the proposed approach can estimate peer influence more accurately than existing parameterized approaches and data-driven methods. We applied the proposed framework in an empirical study of players' online gaming behaviors. First, our approach can achieve improved model fitness for estimating peer influence in online games. Second, we discover a heterogeneous effect of peer influence: players with higher tenure and playing levels receive stronger peer influence. Finally, our results suggest that the homophily effect has a stronger influence on players' behavior than peer influence.},

  abstract = {In applied multivariate statistics, estimating the number of latent dimensions or the number of clusters is a fundamental and recurring problem. One common diagnostic is the scree plot, which shows the largest eigenvalues of the data matrix in decreasing order; the user searches for a ``gap'' or ``elbow'' in the decaying eigenvalues; unfortunately, these patterns can hide beneath the bias of the sample eigenvalues. This methodological problem is conceptually difficult because, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of the k population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue that the correct choice of k is the number of detectable dimensions. We alleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class of random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a p-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this sample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent dimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions are not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all k dimensions can be estimated, we prove that our procedure consistently estimates k. In simulations and a data example, the proposed estimator compares favorably to alternative approaches in both computational and statistical performance.},

  abstract = {Mediation analysis is an important tool in the behavioral sciences for investigating the role of intermediate variables that lie in the path between a treatment and an outcome variable. The influence of the intermediate variable on the outcome is often explored using a linear structural equation model (LSEM), with model coefficients interpreted as possible effects. While there has been significant research on the topic, little work has been done when the intermediate variable (mediator) is a high-dimensional vector. In this work we introduce a novel method for identifying potential mediators in this setting called the directions of mediation (DMs). DMs linearly combine potential mediators into a smaller number of orthogonal components, with components ranked by the proportion of the LSEM likelihood (assuming normally distributed errors) each accounts for. This method is well suited for cases when many potential mediators are measured. Examples of high-dimensional potential mediators are brain images composed of hundreds of thousands of voxels, genetic variation measured at millions of SNPs, or vectors of thousands of variables in large-scale epidemiological studies. We demonstrate the method using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of thermal pain where we are interested in determining which brain locations mediate the relationship between the application of a thermal stimulus and self-reported pain.},

However, due to its large scale, traditional analysis methods often become inadequate. In this paper, we propose a sequential sampling enhanced composite likelihood approach for efficient estimation of social intercorrelations in large-scale networks using the spatial model. Given a known population network, the proposed approach sequentially takes small samples from the network, and adaptively improves model parameter estimates through learnings obtained from previous samples. In comparison to population-based maximum likelihood estimation that is computationally prohibitive when the network size is large, the proposed approach makes it computationally feasible to analyze large networks and provide efficient estimation of social intercorrelations among members in large networks. In comparison to sample-based estimation that relies on information purely from the sample and produces underestimation bias in social intercorrelation estimates, the proposed approach effectively uses information from the population without compromising computation efficiency. Through simulation studies based on simulated networks and real networks, we demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed approach over benchmark estimation methods and discuss managerial implications. We also discuss extension of the proposed approach in the context of an unknown population network structure, as well as in an alternative form of the spatial model.},

Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal statistical approach for identifying and estimating these causal effects. Central to CMA is the sequential ignorability assumption that implies all pre-treatment confounders are measured and they can capture different types of confounding, e.g., post-treatment confounders and hidden confounders. Typically unverifiable in observational studies, this assumption restrains both the coverage and practicality of conventional methods. This work, therefore, aims to circumvent the stringent assumption by following a causal graph with a unified confounder and its proxy variables. Our core contribution is an algorithm that combines deep latent-variable models and proxy strategy to jointly infer a unified surrogate confounder and estimate different causal effects in CMA from observed variables. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The standard approach for estimating NIE and MP is through the product method, which involves an model for the outcome conditional on the mediator and exposure and another model describing the exposure\textendash mediator relationship. The purpose of this article is to comprehensively develop and investigate the finite-sample performance of NIE and MP estimators via the product method. With four common data types, we propose closed-form interval estimators via the theory of estimating equations and multivariate delta method, and evaluate its empirical performance relative to the bootstrap approach. In addition, we have observed that the rare outcome assumption is frequently invoked to approximate the NIE and MP with a binary outcome, although this approximation may lead to non-negligible bias when the outcome is common. We therefore introduce the exact expressions for NIE and MP with a binary outcome without the rare outcome assumption and compare its performance with the approximate estimators. Based upon these theoretical developments and empirical studies, we offer several practical recommendations to inform practice. An R package mediateP is developed to implement the methods for point and variance estimation discussed in this paper.},

The amount of interference is allowed to grow with the population size. We then provide a central limit theorem for the differencein-means estimator that can handle interference that exists between all pairs of units, provided most of the interference is captured by a restricted-degree dependency graph. The asymptotic variance admits a decomposition into two terms: (a) the variance that is expected under no-interference and (b) the additional variance contributed by interference. We propose a conservative variance estimator based on this variance decomposition. The results arise as an application of Stein's method. For practitioners, our results show that standard estimators continue to exhibit normality in large sample sizes and that inference can be made robust to mild forms of interference.},

This paper proposes regression adjustment estimators for removing bias due to interference in Bernoulli randomized experiments. We use a fitted model to predict the counterfactual outcomes of global control and global treatment. Our work differs from standard regression adjustments in that the adjustment variables are constructed from functions of the treatment assignment vector, and that we allow the researcher to use a collection of any functions correlated with the response, turning the problem of detecting interference into a feature engineering problem. We characterize the distribution of the proposed estimator in a linear model setting and connect the results to the standard theory of regression adjustments under SUTVA. We then propose an estimator that allows for flexible machine learning estimators to be used for fitting a nonlinear interference functional form. We propose conducting statistical inference via bootstrap and resampling methods, which allow us to sidestep the complicated dependences implied by interference and instead rely on empirical covariance structures. Such variance estimation relies on an exogeneity assumption akin to the standard unconfoundedness assumption invoked in observational studies. In simulation experiments, our methods are better at debiasing estimates than existing inverse propensity weighted estimators based on neighborhood exposure modeling. We use our method to reanalyze an experiment concerning weather insurance adoption conducted on a collection of villages in rural China.},

We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. Methods We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The bodymass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors. N Engl J Med 2007;357:370-9. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society. Results Discernible clusters of obese persons were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40\% (95\% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37\% (95\% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other as compared with those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network. Conclusions Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.},

Unlike networked data in traditional graph learning tasks, such as node classification and link detection, the networked data under the causal inference problem has its particularity, i.e., imbalanced network structure. In this paper, we propose a Graph Infomax Adversarial Learning (GIAL) model for treatment effect estimation, which makes full use of the network structure to capture more information by recognizing the imbalance in network structure.

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting.The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as `extreme scenarios'. Finally, we describe problems with a common `benchmarking' practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates.

Our framework utilizes the highly general class of Exponential-family Random Network models (ERNM) of which Markov Random Fields (MRF) and Exponential-family Random Graph models (ERGM) are special cases.

The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of using observational data to estimate peer contagion effects, the influence of treatments applied to individuals in a network on the outcomes of their neighbors. A main challenge to such estimation is that homophily\textemdash the tendency of connected units to share similar latent traits\textemdash acts as an unobserved confounder for contagion effects. Informally, it's hard to tell whether your friends have similar outcomes because they were influenced by your treatment, or whether it's due to some common trait that caused you to be friends in the first place. Because these common causes are not usually directly observed, they cannot be simply adjusted for. We describe an approach to perform the required adjustment using node embeddings learned from the network itself. The main aim is to perform this adjustment nonparametrically, without functional form assumptions on either the process that generated the network or the treatment assignment and outcome processes. The key contributions are to nonparametrically formalize the causal effect in a way that accounts for homophily, and to show how embedding methods can be used to identify and estimate this effect.

I will make three points here. First, in my role as the critic in this conversation, I will summarize some arguments about the lack of causal identification in the bulk of settings where the "informal" message of the paper suggests that the deconfounder could be used. This is a point that is discussed at length in D'Amour 2019 [arXiv:1902.10286], which motivated the results concerning causal identification in Theorems 6--8 of "Blessings". Second, I will argue that adding parametric assumptions to the working model in order to obtain identification of causal parameters (a strategy followed in Theorem 6 and in the experimental examples) is a risky strategy, and should only be done when extremely strong prior information is available. Finally, I will consider the implications of the nonparametric identification results provided for a narrow, but non-trivial, set of causal estimands in Theorems 7 and 8. I will highlight that these results may be even more interesting from the perspective of detecting causal identification from observed data, under relatively weak assumptions about confounders.},

  abstract = {The standard linear and logistic regression models assume that the response variables are independent, but share the same linear relationship to their corresponding vectors of covariates. The assumption that the response variables are independent is, however, too strong. In many applications, these responses are collected on nodes of a network, or some spatial or temporal domain, and are dependent. Examples abound in financial and meteorological applications, and dependencies naturally arise in social networks through peer effects. Regression with dependent responses has thus received a lot of attention in the Statistics and Economics literature, but there are no strong consistency results unless multiple independent samples of the vectors of dependent responses can be collected from these models. We present computationally and statistically efficient methods for linear and logistic regression models when the response variables are dependent on a network. Given one sample from a networked linear or logistic regression model and under mild assumptions, we prove strong consistency results for recovering the vector of coefficients and the strength of the dependencies, recovering the rates of standard regression under independent observations. We use projected gradient descent on the negative log-likelihood, or negative log-pseudolikelihood, and establish their strong convexity and consistency using concentration of measure for dependent random variables.},

Most analyses focus on the topological characteristics of networks and the estimation of relationships between the nodes. We adopt a different perspective by considering the whole network as a random variable conveying the effect of an exposure on a response. This point of view represents a classical mediation setting, where the interest lies in estimating the indirect effect, that is, the effect propagated through the mediating variable. We introduce a latent space model mapping the network into a space of smaller dimension by considering the hidden positions of the units in the network. The coordinates of each node are used as mediators in the relationship between the exposure and the response. We further extend mediation analysis in the latent space framework by using Generalised Linear Models instead of linear ones, as previously done in the literature, adopting an approach based on derivatives to obtain the effects of interest. A Bayesian approach allows us to get the entire distribution of the indirect effect, generally unknown, and compute the corresponding highest density interval, which gives accurate and interpretable bounds for the mediated effect. Finally, an application to social interactions among a group of adolescents and their attitude toward substance use is presented.},

Cooperative learning combines the usual squared error loss of predictions with an ``agreement'' penalty to encourage the predictions from different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the agreement penalty, we get a continuum of solutions that include the well-known early and late fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses the degree of agreement (or fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to estimate test set prediction error. One version of our fitting procedure is modular, where one can choose different fitting mechanisms (e.g. lasso, random forests, boosting, neural networks) appropriate for different data views. In the setting of cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty. The method can be especially powerful when the different data views share some underlying relationship in their signals that we aim to strengthen, while each view has idiosyncratic noise that we aim to reduce. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on simulated and real data examples.},

In practice, many of the covariates may only be proxies of the latent confounding mechanism. Recent work has shown that in certain settings where the standard `no unmeasured confounding' assumption fails, proxy variables can be leveraged to identify causal effects. Results currently exist for the total causal effect of an intervention, but little consideration has been given to learning about the direct or indirect pathways of the effect through a mediator variable. In this work, we describe three separate proximal identification results for natural direct and indirect effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. We then develop a semiparametric framework for inference on natural (in)direct effects, which leads us to locally efficient, multiply robust estimators.},

The validity and generalizability of this work are thus unclear. Here we address two main challenges of working with spatial data (i.e., modifiable areal unit problem and spatial dependencies) and evaluate data-analysis techniques designed to tackle those challenges. To illustrate these issues, we investigate the robustness of regional Big Five personality differences and their correlates within the United States (Study 1; N = 3,387,303) and Germany (Study\,2; N = 110,029). First, we display regional personality differences using a spatial smoothing approach. Second, we account for the modifiable areal unit problem by examining the correlates of regional personality scores across multiple spatial levels. Third, we account for spatial dependencies using spatial regression models. Our results suggest that regional psychological differences are robust and can reliably be studied across countries and spatial levels. The results also show that ignoring the methodological challenges of spatial data can have serious consequences for research concerned with regional psychological differences.},

  abstract = {Estimating the effects of interventions in networks is complicated when the units are interacting, such that the outcomes for one unit may depend on the treatment assignment and behavior of many or all other units (i.e., there is interference). When most or all units are in a single connected component, it is impossible to directly experimentally compare outcomes under two or more global treatment assignments since the network can only be observed under a single assignment. Familiar formalism, experimental designs, and analysis methods assume the absence of these interactions, and result in biased estimators of causal effects of interest. While some assumptions can lead to unbiased estimators, these assumptions are generally unrealistic, and we focus this work on realistic assumptions. Thus, in this work, we evaluate methods for designing and analyzing randomized experiments that aim to reduce this bias and thereby reduce overall error. In design, we consider the ability to perform random assignment to treatments that is correlated in the network, such as through graph cluster randomization. In analysis, we consider incorporating information about the treatment assignment of network neighbors. We prove sufficient conditions for bias reduction through both design and analysis in the presence of potentially global interference. Through simulations of the entire process of experimentation in networks, we measure the performance of these methods under varied network structure and varied social behaviors, finding substantial bias and error reductions. These improvements are largest for networks with more clustering and data generating processes with both stronger direct effects of the treatment and stronger interactions between units.},

We argue that nearly all text-based causal inferences depend upon a latent representation of the text and we provide a framework to learn the latent representation. But estimating this latent representation, we show, creates new risks: we may introduce an identification problem or overfit. To address these risks we describe a split-sample framework and apply it to estimate causal effects from an experiment on immigration attitudes and a study on bureaucratic response.

In this article, we study an urgent social problem, the spatial diffusion of hate crimes against refugees in Germany, which has admitted more than 1 million asylum seekers since the 2015 refugee crisis. Despite its importance, identification of causal diffusion effects, also known as peer and contagion effects, remains challenging because the commonly used assumption of no omitted confounders is often untenable due to contextual confounding and homophily bias. To address this long-standing problem, we examine causal identification using placebo outcomes under a new assumption of structural stationarity, which formalizes the underlying diffusion process with a class of nonparametric structural equation models with recursive structure. We show under structural stationarity that a lagged dependent variable is a general, valid placebo outcome for detecting a wide range of biases, including the two types mentioned above. We then propose a differencein-differences style estimator that can directly correct biases under an additional causal assumption. Analyzing fine-grained geo-coded hate crime data from Germany, we show when and how the proposed methods can detect and correct unmeasured confounding in spatial causal diffusion analysis.},

However, it is well known that identification and estimation of causal peer effects are challenging in observational studies for two reasons. The first is the identification challenge due to unmeasured network confounding, for example, homophily bias and contextual confounding. The second issue is network dependence of observations, which one must take into account for valid statistical inference. Negative control variables, also known as placebo variables, have been widely used in observational studies including peer effect analysis over networks, although they have been used primarily for bias detection. In this article, we establish a formal framework which leverages a pair of negative control outcome and exposure variables (double negative controls) to nonparametrically identify causal peer effects in the presence of unmeasured network confounding. We then propose a generalized method of moments estimator for causal peer effects, and establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under an assumption about {$\psi$}-network dependence. Finally, we provide a network heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance estimator. Our methods are illustrated with an application to peer effects in education.},

In many social science experiments, such spillover effects may occur through multiple networks, for example, through both online and offline face-to-face networks in a Twitter experiment. Thus, to understand how people use different networks, it is essential to estimate the spillover effect in each specific network separately. However, the unbiased estimation of these network-specific spillover effects requires an often-violated assumption that researchers observe all relevant networks. We show that, unlike conventional omitted variable bias, bias due to unobserved networks remains even when treatment assignment is randomized and when unobserved networks and a network of interest are independently generated. We then develop parametric and nonparametric sensitivity analysis methods, with which researchers can assess the potential influence of unobserved networks on causal findings. We illustrate the proposed methods with a simulation study based on a real-world Twitter network and an empirical application based on a network field experiment in China.},

Our technical contribution is to provide limit theorems for modularity when a community assignment is given by nodal features or covariates. These theorems hold for a broad class of network models over a range of sparsity regimes, as well as for weighted, multiedge, and power-law networks. This allows us to assign p-values to observed community structure, which we validate using several benchmark examples from the literature.

We consider the average indirect effect of a binary treatment operating through an intermediate variable (or mediator) on the causal path between the treatment and the outcome, as well as the unmediated direct effect. Estimation is based on efficient score functions, which possess a multiple robustness property w.r.t. misspecifications of the outcome, mediator, and treatment models. This property is key for selecting these models by double machine learning, which is combined with data splitting to prevent overfitting in the estimation of the effects of interest. We demonstrate that the direct and indirect effect estimators are asymptotically normal and root-n consistent under specific regularity conditions and investigate the finite sample properties of the suggested methods in a simulation study when considering lasso as machine learner. We also provide an empirical application to the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, assessing the indirect effect of health insurance coverage on general health operating via routine checkups as mediator, as well as the direct effect. We find a moderate short-term effect of health insurance coverage on general health which is, however, not mediated by routine checkups.},

  abstract = {A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal relationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the performance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational linguistics community.},

  abstract = {Understanding predictions made by deep neural networks is notoriously difficult, but also crucial to their dissemination. As all machine learning based methods, they are as good as their training data, and can also capture unwanted biases. While there are tools that can help understand whether such biases exist, they do not distinguish between correlation and causation, and might be ill-suited for text-based models and for reasoning about high level language concepts. A key problem of estimating the causal effect of a concept of interest on a given model is that this estimation requires the generation of counterfactual examples, which is challenging with existing generation technology. To bridge that gap, we propose CausaLM, a framework for producing causal model explanations using counterfactual language representation models. Our approach is based on fine-tuning of deep contextualized embedding models with auxiliary adversarial tasks derived from the causal graph of the problem. Concretely, we show that by carefully choosing auxiliary adversarial pre-training tasks, language representation models such as BERT can effectively learn a counterfactual representation for a given concept of interest, and be used to estimate its true causal effect on model performance. A byproduct of our method is a language representation model that is unaffected by the tested concept, which can be useful in mitigating unwanted bias ingrained in the data.},

Spectral partitioning using the normalized Laplacian and the adjacency matrix have both been shown to be consistent as the number of vertices tend to infinity. Importantly, both procedures require that the number of blocks and the rank of the communication probability matrix be known, even as the rest of the parameters may be unknown. In this paper, we prove that the (suitably modified) adjacency-spectral partitioning procedure, requiring only an upper bound on the rank of the communication probability matrix, is consistent. Indeed, this result demonstrates a robustness to model mis-specification; an overestimate of the rank may impose a moderate performance penalty, but the procedure is still consistent. Furthermore, we extend this procedure to the setting where adjacencies may have multiple modalities and we allow for either directed or undirected graphs.},

  abstract = {Causal inference on a population of units connected through a network often presents technical challenges, including how to account for interference. In the presence of interference, for instance, potential outcomes of a unit depend on their treatment as well as on the treatments of other units, such as their neighbors in the network. In observational studies, a further complication is that the typical unconfoundedness assumption must be extended\textemdash say, to include the treatment of neighbors, and individual and neighborhood covariates\textemdash to guarantee identification and valid inference. Here, we propose new estimands that define treatment and interference effects. We then derive analytical expressions for the bias of a naive estimator that wrongly assumes away interference. The bias depends on the level of interference but also on the degree of association between individual and neighborhood treatments. We propose an extended unconfoundedness assumption that accounts for interference, and we develop new covariateadjustment methods that lead to valid estimates of treatment and interference effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. We carry out simulations, calibrated using friendship networks and covariates in a nationally representative longitudinal study of adolescents in grades 7\textendash 12 in the United States, to explore finite-sample performance in different realistic settings.

We discuss existing test statistics used in network permutation tests and propose several new statistics.

  abstract = {Background: Child maltreatment (CM) is associated with an increased risk to develop symptoms of depression/ anxiety across an individual's lifespan. Recent studies indicated that impairments in personality functioning might mediate this association. The purpose of this study is to add evidence of this mediating effect by regarding different types of CM (emotional, physical and sexual abuse as well as emotional and physical neglect) in the general population. Methods: A representative sample of the German population (N = 2,354) completed a set of standardized mea\- sures (OPD-SQS: Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis - Structure Questionnaire Short, PHQ-4: Patient Health Questionnaire, CTQ: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire). Mediation analyses were carried out to examine the association between CM types, symptoms of depression/anxiety, and personality functioning. Results: Up to two-thirds of the associations between CM types and symptoms of depression/anxiety are mediated by personality functioning [indirect effect: emotional abuse ({$\beta$} = 0.219, 95\%-CI: 0.187\textendash 0.251, p {$<$} .001), physical abuse ({$\beta$} = 0.151, 95\%-CI: 0.123\textendash 0.178, p {$<$} .001), sexual abuse ({$\beta$} = 0.163, 95\%-CI: 0.138\textendash 0.188, p {$<$} .001), emotional neglect ({$\beta$} = 0.131, 95\%-CI: 0.104\textendash 0.159, p {$<$} .001) and physical neglect ({$\beta$} = 0.102, 95\%-CI: 0.078\textendash 0.127, p {$<$} .001)]. Limitations: Symptoms of depression/anxiety were measured with screening instruments and results are based on cross-sectional data. Conclusions: The present investigation expands the evidence on the mediating effect of personality functioning in the association between CM and depression/anxiety symptoms based on data of the general population. Our results show the relevance of types, as the mediating effects are slightly stronger in CM abuse types than in CM neglect types. Knowledge about impaired personality might be an angle for clinical interventions and inspire future research.},

Recent advances in this area have established formal conditions for identification and estimation of natural direct and indirect effects. However, these conditions typically involve stringent no unmeasured confounding assumptions and that the mediator has been measured without error. These assumptions may fail to hold in practice where mediation methods are often applied. The goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we show that the natural indirect effect can in fact be identified in the presence of unmeasured exposure-outcome confounding provided there is no additive interaction between the mediator and unmeasured confounder(s). Second, we introduce a new estimator of the natural indirect effect that is robust to both classical measurement error of the mediator and unmeasured confounding of both exposure-outcome and mediator-outcome relations under certain no interaction assumptions. We provide formal proofs and a simulation study to demonstrate our results.},

The goal of the paper is to introduce a new form of indirect effect, the population intervention indirect effect, that can be non-parametrically identified in the presence of an unmeasured common cause of exposure and outcome. This new type of indirect effect captures the extent to which the effect of exposure is mediated by an intermediate variable under an intervention that holds the component of exposure directly influencing the outcome at its observed value. The population intervention indirect effect is in fact the indirect component of the population intervention effect, introduced by Hubbard and Van der Laan. Interestingly, our identification criterion generalizes Judea Pearl's front door criterion as it does not require no direct effect of exposure not mediated by the intermediate variable. For inference, we develop both parametric and semiparametric methods, including a novel doubly robust semiparametric locally efficient estimator, that perform very well in simulation studies. Finally, the methods proposed are used to measure the effectiveness of monetary saving recommendations among women enrolled in a maternal health programme in Tanzania.},

Many models have been proposed for the analysis of such multi-view network data under the assumption that the data views are closely related. In this paper, we provide tools for evaluating this assumption. In particular, we ask: given two networks that each follow a stochastic block model, is there an association between the latent community memberships of the nodes in the two networks? To answer this question, we extend the stochastic block model for a single network view to the two-view setting, and develop a new hypothesis test for the null hypothesis that the latent community memberships in the two data views are independent. We apply our test to protein-protein interaction data from the HINT database (Das and Yu, 2012b). We find evidence of a weak association between the latent community memberships of proteins defined with respect to binary interaction data and the latent community memberships of proteins defined with respect to cocomplex association data. We also extend this proposal to the setting of a network with node covariates. The proposed methods extend readily to three or more network/multivariate data views.},

However, little is known in practice about how different algorithms over or underfit to real networks, or how to reliably assess such behavior across algorithms. Here, we present a broad investigation of over and underfitting across 16 state-of-the-art community detection algorithms applied to a novel benchmark corpus of 572 structurally diverse real-world networks. We find that (i) algorithms vary widely in the number and composition of communities they find, given the same input; (ii) algorithms can be clustered into distinct high-level groups based on similarities of their outputs on real-world networks; (iii) algorithmic differences induce wide variation in accuracy on link-based learning tasks; and, (iv) no algorithm is always the best at such tasks across all inputs. Finally, we quantify each algorithm's overall tendency to over or underfit to network data using a theoretically principled diagnostic, and discuss the implications for future advances in community detection.},

Specifically, we establish (i) a new hidden front-door criterion which extends the classical front-door result to allow for hidden mediators for which proxies are available; (ii) We extend causal mediation analysis to identify direct and indirect causal effects under unconfoundedness conditions in a setting where the mediator in view is hidden, but error prone proxies of the latter are available. We view (i) and (ii) as important steps towards the practical application of front-door criteria and mediation analysis as mediators are almost always error prone and thus, the most one can hope for in practice is that our measurements are at best proxies of mediating mechanisms. Finally, we show that identification of certain causal effects remains possible even in settings where challenges in (i) and (ii) might co-exist.},

  abstract = {Many spatial phenomena exhibit treatment interference where treatments at one location may affect the response at other locations. Because interference violates the stable unit treatment value assumption, standard methods for causal inference do not apply. We propose a new causal framework to recover direct and spill-over effects in the presence of spatial interference, taking into account that treatments at nearby locations are more influential than treatments at locations further apart. Under the no unmeasured confounding assumption, we show that a generalized propensity score is sufficient to remove all measured confounding. To reduce dimensionality issues, we propose a Bayesian spline-based regression model accounting for a sufficient set of variables for the generalized propensity score. A simulation study demonstrates the accuracy and coverage properties. We apply the method to estimate the causal effect of wildland fires on air pollution in the Western United States over 2005\textendash 2018.},

We give a clear account of spatial confounding as the existence of an unmeasured confounding variable with a spatial structure. Under certain conditions, including the smoothness of the confounder as a function of space, we show that spatial covariates (e.g. latitude and longitude) can be handled as typical covariates by algorithms popular in causal inference. We focus on ``double machine learning'' (DML) by which flexible models are fit for both the exposure and outcome variables to arrive at a causal estimator with favorable convergence properties. These models avoid restrictive assumptions, such as linearity and heterogeneity, which are present in linear models typically employed in spatial statistics and which can lead to strong bias when violated. We demonstrate the advantages of the DML approach analytically and via extensive simulation studies.},

In this paper, we derive necessary conditions on the coherence between the treatment variable of interest and the unmeasured confounder that ensure the causal effect of the treatment is estimable. We specify our model and assumptions in the spectral domain to allow for different degrees of confounding at different spatial resolutions. The key assumption that ensures identifiability is that confounding present at global scales dissipates at local scales. We show that this assumption in the spectral domain is equivalent to adjusting for global-scale confounding in the spatial domain by adding a spatially smoothed version of the treatment variable to the mean of the response variable. Within this general framework, we propose a sequence of confounder adjustment methods that range from parametric adjustments based on the Mat\textasciiacute ern coherence function to more robust semiparametric methods that use smoothing splines. These ideas are applied to areal and geostatistical data for both simulated and real datasets.},

  abstract = {In many scenarios, the observational data needed for causal inferences are spread over two data files. In particular, we consider scenarios where one file includes covariates and the treatment measured on one set of individuals, and a second file includes responses measured on another, partially overlapping set of individuals. In the absence of error free direct identifiers like social security numbers, straightforward merging of separate files is not feasible, so that records must be linked using error-prone variables such as names, birth dates, and demographic characteristics. Typical practice in such situations generally follows a two-stage procedure: first link the two files using a probabilistic linkage technique, then make causal inferences with the linked dataset. This does not propagate uncertainty due to imperfect linkages to the causal inference, nor does it leverage relationships among the study variables to improve the quality of the linkages. We propose a hierarchical model for simultaneous Bayesian inference on probabilistic linkage and causal effects that addresses these deficiencies. Using simulation studies and theoretical arguments, we show the hierarchical model can improve the accuracy of estimated treatment effects, as well as the record linkages, compared to the two-stage modeling option. We illustrate the hierarchical model using a causal study of the effects of debit card possession on household spending.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the relationship between a measure of creativity and the human brain network for subjects in a brain connectome dataset obtained using a diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging procedure. We identify brain regions and interconnections that have a significant effect on creativity. Brain networks are often expressed in terms of symmetric adjacency matrices, with row and column indices of the matrix representing the regions of interest (ROI), and a cell entry signifying the estimated number of fiber bundles connecting the corresponding row and column ROIs. Current statistical practices for regression analysis with the brain network as the predictor and the measure of creativity as the response typically vectorize the network predictor matrices prior to any analysis, thus failing to account for the important structural information in the network. This results in poor inferential and predictive performance in presence of small sample sizes. To answer the scientific questions discussed above, we develop a flexible Bayesian framework that avoids reshaping the network predictor matrix, draws inference on brain ROIs and interconnections significantly related to creativity, and enables accurate prediction of creativity from a brain network. A novel class of network shrinkage priors for the coefficient corresponding to the network predictor is proposed to achieve these goals simultaneously. The Bayesian framework allows characterization of uncertainty in the findings. Empirical results in simulation studies illustrate substantial inferential and predictive gains of the proposed framework in comparison with the ordinary high-dimensional Bayesian shrinkage priors and penalized optimization schemes. Our framework yields new insights into the relationship of brain regions with creativity, also providing the uncertainty associated with the scientific findings.

While literature on statistical modeling of network data typically involves analysis of a single network, the recent emergence of complex data in several biological applications, including brain imaging studies, presents a need to devise a network classifier for subjects. This article considers an application from a brain connectome study, where the overarching goal is to classify subjects into two separate groups based on their brain network data, along with identifying influential regions of interest (ROIs) (referred to as nodes). Existing approaches either treat all edge weights as a long vector or summarize the network information with a few summary measures. Both these approaches ignore the full network structure, may lead to less desirable inference in small samples and are not designed to identify significant network nodes. We propose a novel binary logistic regression framework with the network as the predictor and a binary response, the network predictor coefficient being modeled using a novel class global-local shrinkage priors. The framework is able to accurately detect nodes and edges in the network influencing the classification. Our framework is implemented using an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Theoretically, we show asymptotically optimal classification for the proposed framework when the number of network edges grows faster than the sample size. The framework is empirically validated by extensive simulation studies and analysis of a brain connectome data.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual evaluation of novel treatment assignment functions (e.g., advertising algorithms and recommender systems) is one of the most crucial causal inference problems for practitioners. Traditionally, randomized controlled trials (A/B tests) are performed to evaluate treatment assignment functions. However, such trials can be time-consuming, expensive, and even unethical in some cases. Therefore, offline counterfactual evaluation of treatment assignment functions becomes a pressing issue because a massive amount of observational data is available in today's big data era. Counterfactual evaluation requires handling the hidden confounders \textendash{} the unmeasured features which causally influence both the treatment assignment and the outcome. To deal with the hidden confounders, most of the existing methods rely on the assumption of no hidden confounders. However, this assumption can be untenable in the context of massive observational data. When such data comes with network information, the later can be potentially useful to correct hidden confounding bias. As such, we first formulate a novel problem, counterfactual evaluation of treatment assignment functions with networked observational data. Then, we investigate the following research questions: How can we utilize network information in counterfactual evaluation? Can network information improve the estimates in counterfactual evaluation? Toward answering these questions, first, we propose a novel framework, Counterfactual Network Evaluator (CONE), which (1) learns partial representations of latent confounders under the supervision of observed treatments and outcomes; and (2) combines them for counterfactual evaluation. Then through extensive experiments, we corroborate the effectiveness of CONE. The results imply that incorporating network information mitigates hidden confounding bias in counterfactual evaluation.},

Such data poses the challenge of confounding bias. Previous work presents two desiderata to handle confounding bias. On the treatment group level, we aim to balance the distributions of confounder representations. On the individual level, it is desirable to capture patterns of hidden confounders that predict treatment assignments. Existing methods show the potential of utilizing network information to handle confounding bias, but they only tries to satisfy one of the two desiderata. This is because the two desiderata seem to contradict each other. When the two distributions of confounder representations are highly overlapped, then we confront the undiscriminating problem between the treated and the controlled. In this work, we formulate the two desiderata as a minimax game. We propose IGNITE, a novel framework to learn representations of confounders from networked observational data, which is trained by a minimax game to achieve the two desiderata. Experiments verify the efficacy of IGNITE on two datasets under various settings.},

We derive sufficient conditions for consistency of both estimators and propose a variational approximation to the MLE that is computationally feasible for large networks. We verify the sufficient conditions via simulation and demonstrate that they are practical.

In this paper, we suggest a universal approach to rank inference via residual subsampling (RIRS) for testing and estimating rank in a wide family of models, including many popularly used network models such as the degree corrected mixed membership model as a special case. Our procedure constructs a test statistic via subsampling entries of the residual matrix after extracting the spiked components. The test statistic converges in distribution to the standard normal under the null hypothesis, and diverges to infinity with asymptotic probability one under the alternative hypothesis. The effectiveness of RIRS procedure is justified theoretically, utilizing the asymptotic expansions of eigenvectors and eigenvalues for large random matrices recently developed in [8] and [9]. The advantages of the newly suggested procedure are demonstrated through several simulation and real data examples.},

Network data often exhibit transitivity, meaning that two actors that have ties to a third actor are more likely to be tied than actors that do not, homophily by attributes of the actors or dyads, and clustering. Interest often focuses on finding clusters of actors or ties, and the number of groups in the data is typically unknown. We propose a new model, the latent position cluster model, under which the probability of a tie between two actors depends on the distance between them in an unobserved Euclidean 'social space', and the actors' locations in the latent social space arise from a mixture of distributions, each corresponding to a cluster. We propose two estimation methods: a two-stage maximum likelihood method and a fully Bayesian method that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The former is quicker and simpler, but the latter performs better. We also propose a Bayesian way of determining the number of clusters that are present by using approximate conditional Bayes factors. Our model represents transitivity, homophily by attributes and clustering simultaneously and does not require the number of clusters to be known. The model makes it easy to simulate realistic networks with clustering, which are potentially useful as inputs to models of more complex systems of which the network is part, such as epidemic models of infectious disease. We apply the model to two networks of social relations. A free software package in the R statistical language, latentnet, is available to analyse data by using the model.},

While most tensor decomposition methods are developed for a single tensor observation, scientific studies often collect side information, in the form of node features and interactions thereof, together with the tensor data. Such data problems are common in neuroimaging, network analysis, and spatial-temporal modeling. Identifying the relationship between a high-dimensional tensor and side information is important yet challenging. Here, we develop a tensor decomposition method that incorporates multiple feature matrices as side information. Unlike unsupervised tensor decomposition, our supervised decomposition captures the effective dimension reduction of the data tensor confined to feature space of interest. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm with provable spectral initialization is further developed. Our proposal handles a broad range of data types, including continuous, count, and binary observations. We apply the method to diffusion tensor imaging data from human connectome project and multi-relational political network data. We identify the key global connectivity pattern and pinpoint the local regions that are associated with available features.

  year = {2020},
  pages = {11},
  abstract = {The debate about fairness in machine learning has largely centered around competing substantive definitions of what fairness or nondiscrimination between groups requires. However, very little attention has been paid to what precisely a group is. Many recent approaches have abandoned observational, or purely statistical, definitions of fairness in favor of definitions that require one to specify a causal model of the data generating process. The implicit ontological assumption of these exercises is that a racial or sex group is a collection of individuals who share a trait or attribute, for example: the group ``female'' simply consists in grouping individuals who share female-coded sex features. We show this by exploring the formal assumption of modularity in causal models, which holds that the dependencies captured by one causal pathway are invariant to interventions on any other causal pathways. Modeling sex, for example, in a causal model proposes two substantive claims: 1) There exists a feature, sex-on-its-own, that is an inherent trait of an individual that then (causally) brings about social phenomena external to it in the world; and 2) the relations between sex and its downstream effects can be modified in whichever ways and the former feature would still retain the meaning that sex has in our world. We argue that these ontological assumptions about social groups like sex are conceptual errors. Many of the ``effects'' that sex purportedly ``causes'' are in fact constitutive features of sex as a social status. Together, they give the social meaning of sex features, and these social meanings are precisely what make sex discrimination a distinctively morally problematic type of act that differs from mere irrationality or meanness on the basis of a physical feature. Correcting this conceptual error has a number of important implications for how analytic models can be used to detect discrimination. If what makes something discrimination on the basis of a particular social grouping is that the practice acts on what it means to be in that group in a way that we deem wrongful, then what we need from analytic diagrams is a model of what constitutes the social grouping. Only then can we have a normative debate about what is fair or nondiscriminatory vis-\`a-vis that group. We suggest that formal diagrams of constitutive relations would present an entirely different path toward reasoning about discrimination (and relatedly, counterfactuals) because they proffer a model of how the meaning of a social group emerges from its constitutive features. Whereas the value of causal diagrams is to guide the construction and testing of sophisticated modular counterfactuals, the value of constitutive diagrams would be to identify a different kind of counterfactual as central to an inquiry on discrimination: one that asks how the social meaning of a group would be changed if its non-modular features were altered.},

We characterize the marginal mediation effect, the multivariate component-wise mediation effects, and the L2 norm of the component-wise effects, and develop a MonteCarlo procedure for evaluating their statistical significance. To accommodate the setting with a large number of mediators and a small sample size, we further propose a transformation model using the spectral decomposition. Under the transformation model, mediation effects can be estimated using a series of regression models with a univariate transformed mediator, and examined by our proposed testing procedure. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of our methods for continuous and dichotomous outcomes. We apply the methods to analyze genomic data investigating the effect of microRNA miR-223 on a dichotomous survival status of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We identify nine gene ontology sets with expression values that significantly mediate the effect of miR-223 on GBM survival.},

  abstract = {Ecological occupancy modeling has historically relied on high-quality, low-quantity designedsurvey data for estimation and prediction. In recent years, there has been a large increase in the amount of high-quantity, unknown-quality opportunistic data. This has motivated research on how best to combine these two data sources in order to optimize inference. Existing methods can be infeasible for large datasets or require opportunistic data to be located where designed-survey data exist. These methods map species occupancies, motivating a need to properly evaluate covariate effects (e.g., land cover proportion) on their distributions. We describe a spatial estimation method for supplementarily including additional opportunistic data using mediation analysis concepts. The opportunistic data mediate the effect of the covariate on the designed-survey data response, decomposing it into a direct and indirect effect. A component of the indirect effect can then be quickly estimated via regressing the mediator on the covariate, while the other components are estimated through a spatial occupancy model. The regression step allows for use of large quantities of opportunistic data that can be collected in locations with no designed-survey data available. Simulation results suggest that the mediated method produces an improvement in relative MSE when the data are of reasonable quality. However, when the simulated opportunistic data are poorly correlated with the true spatial process, the standard, unmediated method is still preferable. A spatiotemporal extension of the method is also developed for analyzing the effect of deciduous forest land cover on red-eyed vireo distribution in the southeastern United States and find that including the opportunistic data do not lead to a substantial improvement. Opportunistic data quality remains an important consideration when employing this method, as with other data integration methods.},

We propose a new parameterization of the spatial generalized linear mixed model that alleviates spatial confounding and speeds computation by greatly reducing the dimension of the spatial random effects. We illustrate the application of our approach to simulated binary, count and Gaussian spatial data sets, and to a large infant mortality data set.},

We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

We make three contributions to improve research on causal mechanisms. First, we present a minimum set of assumptions required under standard designs of experimental and observational studies and develop a general algorithm for estimating causal mediation effects. Second, we provide a method for assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to potential violations of a key assumption.

It has not been clear when estimates from the Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition can be interpreted causally because its implementation does not explicitly address potential confounding of target variables. While mediation analysis does explicitly adjust for confounders of target variables, it typically does so in a way that effectively entails equalizing confounders across racial groups, which may not reflect the intended intervention. Revisiting prior analyses in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on disparities in wages, unemployment, incarceration, and overall health with test scores, taken as a proxy for educational attainment, as a target intervention, we propose and demonstrate a novel decomposition that controls for confounders of test scores (e.g., measures of childhood socioeconomic status [SES]) while leaving their association with race intact. We compare this decomposition with others that use standardization (to equalize childhood SES [the confounders] alone), mediation analysis (to equalize test scores within levels of childhood SES), and one that equalizes both childhood SES and test scores. We also show how these decompositions, including our novel proposals, are equivalent to implementations of the Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition but provide a more formal causal interpretation for these decompositions.},

The proposed model can be applied to the network processes with various underlying structures but with independent edges. As an illustration, an AR(1) stochastic block model has been investigated in depth, which characterizes the latent communities by the transition probabilities over time. This leads to a new and more effective spectral clustering algorithm for identifying the latent communities. We have derived a finite sample condition under which the perfect recovery of the community structure can be achieved by the newly defined spectral clustering algorithm. Furthermore the inference for a change point is incorporated into the AR(1) stochastic block model to cater for possible structure changes. We have derived the explicit error rates for the maximum likelihood estimator of the change-point. Application with three real data sets illustrates both relevance and usefulness of the proposed AR(1) models and the associate inference methods.},

  abstract = {How human behavior is influenced by a social network that they belong has been an interested topic in applied research. Existing methods often utilized scale-level behavioral data to estimate the influence of a social network on human behavior. This study proposes a novel approach to studying social influence by using item-level behavioral measures. Under the latent space modeling framework, we integrate the two latent spaces for respondents' social network data and item-level behavior measures. We then measure social influence as the impact of the latent space configuration contributed by the social network data on the behavior data. The performance and properties of the proposed approach are evaluated via simulation studies. We apply the proposed model to an empirical dataset to explain how students' friendship network influences their participation in school activities.},

We model the network with the \{\textbackslash it degree-corrected mixed membership (DCMM)\} model \textbackslash cite\{Mixed-SCORE\}. Since for many natural networks, the degrees have an approximate power-law tail, we allow \{\textbackslash it severe degree heterogeneity\} in our model. For any membership estimation \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash pi\}\_i, 1 \textbackslash leq i \textbackslash leq n\textbackslash\}\$, since each \$\textbackslash pi\_i\$ is a probability mass function, it is natural to measure the errors by the average \$\textbackslash ell\^1\$-norm \textbackslash [ \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{n\} \textbackslash sum\_\{i = 1\}\^n \textbackslash | \textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash pi\}\_i - \textbackslash pi\_i\textbackslash |\_1. \textbackslash ] We also consider a variant of the \$\textbackslash ell\^1\$-loss, where each \$\textbackslash |\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash pi\}\_i - \textbackslash pi\_i\textbackslash |\_1\$ is re-weighted by the degree parameter \$\textbackslash theta\_i\$ in DCMM (to be introduced). We present a sharp lower bound. We also show that such a lower bound is achievable under a broad situation. More discussion in this vein is continued in our forthcoming manuscript. The results are very different from those on community detection. For community detection, the focus is on the special case where all \$\textbackslash pi\_i\$ are degenerate; the goal is clustering, so Hamming distance is the natural choice of loss function, and the rate can be exponentially fast. The setting here is broader and more difficult: it is more natural to use the \$\textbackslash ell\^1\$-loss, and the rate is only polynomially fast.},

Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks.

  abstract = {A common causal identification strategy in political science is selection on observables. This strategy assumes one observes a set of covariates that is, after statistical adjustment, sufficient to make treatment status as-if random. Under adjustment methods such as matching or inverse probability weighting, coefficients for control variables are treated as nuisance parameters and are not directly estimated. This is in direct contrast to regression approaches where estimated parameters are obtained for all covariates. Analysts often find it tempting to give a causal interpretation to all the parameters in such regression models\textemdash indeed, such interpretations are often central to the proposed research design. In this paper, we ask when we can justify interpreting two or more coefficients in a regression model as causal parameters. We demonstrate that analysts must appeal to causal identification assumptions to give estimates causal interpretations. Under selection on observables, this task is complicated by the fact that more than one causal effect might be identified. We show how causal graphs provide a framework for clearly delineating which effects are presumed to be identified and thus merit a causal interpretation, and which are not. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how researchers should interpret estimates from regression models when causal inference is the goal.},

New methods have been introduced to utilize the network structure of predictors, e.g. gene networks, to improve parameter estimation and variable selection. All the existing network-based penalized methods are based on an assumption that parameters, e.g. regression coefficients, of neighboring nodes in a network are close in magnitude, which however may not hold. Here we propose a novel penalized regression method based on a weaker prior assumption that the parameters of neighboring nodes in a network are likely to be zero (or non-zero) at the same time, regardless of their specific magnitudes. We propose a novel non-convex penalty function to incorporate this prior, and an algorithm based on difference convex programming. We use simulated data and two breast cancer gene expression datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over some existing methods. Our proposed methods can be applied to more general problems for group variable selection.},

For prediction (kriging) the bias of the semivariogram estimate induced by using residuals instead of errors has only a minor effect because the bias is small for small lags. However, for estimating the variance of estimated regression coefficients and of predictions, the bias due to using residuals can be quite substantial. Thus we propose a method for reducing this bias. The adjusted empirical semivariogram is then isotonized and made conditionally negative-definite and used to estimate the variance of estimated regression coefficients in a general estimating equations setup. Simulation results for least squares and robust regression show that the proposed methold works wel in linear models with stationary correlated errors.},

  abstract = {Estimating the rank of a corrupted data matrix is an important task in data science, most notably for choosing the number of components in principal component analysis. Significant progress on this task has been made using random matrix theory by characterizing the spectral properties of large noise matrices. However, utilizing such tools is not straightforward when the data matrix consists of count random variables, such as Poisson or binomial, in which case the noise can be heteroskedastic with an unknown variance in each entry. In this work, focusing on a Poisson random matrix with independent entries, we propose a simple procedure termed biwhitening that makes it possible to estimate the rank of the underlying data matrix (i.e., the Poisson parameter matrix) without any prior knowledge on its structure. Our approach is based on the key observation that one can scale the rows and columns of the data matrix simultaneously so that the spectrum of the corresponding noise agrees with the standard Marchenko-Pastur (MP) law, justifying the use of the MP upper edge as a threshold for rank selection. Importantly, the required scaling factors can be estimated directly from the observations by solving a matrix scaling problem via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. Aside from the Poisson distribution, we extend our biwhitening approach to other discrete distributions, such as the generalized Poisson, binomial, multinomial, and negative binomial. We conduct numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings, and demonstrate our approach on real single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, where we show that our results agree with a slightly overdispersed generalized Poisson model.},

Estimating fire attributable PM2.5 concentrations is key to quantifying the impact on air quality and subsequent health burden. This is a challenging problem since only total PM2.5 is measured at monitoring stations and both fire-attributable PM2.5 and PM2.5 from all other sources are correlated in space and time. We propose a framework for estimating fire-contributed PM2.5 and PM2.5 from all other sources using a novel causal inference framework and bias-adjusted chemical model representations of PM2.5 under counterfactual scenarios. The chemical model representation of PM2.5 for this analysis is simulated using Community Multi-Scale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ), run with and without fire emissions across the contiguous U.S. for the 2008-2012 wildfire seasons. The CMAQ output is calibrated with observations from monitoring sites for the same spatial domain and time period. We use a Bayesian model that accounts for spatial variation to estimate the effect of wildland fires on PM2.5 and state assumptions under which the estimate has a valid causal interpretation. Our results include estimates of absolute, relative and cumulative contributions of wildfire smoke to PM2.5 for the contiguous U.S. Additionally, we compute the health burden associated with the PM2.5 attributable to wildfire smoke.},

Many deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to analyze such structures. Given a network, almost all of them partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, according to their connection profile. However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to some extent, generalizes the well-known Stochastic Block Model [Nowicki and Snijders (2001)]. We show that the model is generically identifiable within classes of equivalence and we propose an approximate inference procedure, based on global and local variational techniques. Using toy data sets as well as the French Political Blogosphere network and the transcriptional network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we compare our work with other approaches.},

  abstract = {Linear regression on a set of observations linked by a network has been an essential tool in modeling the relationship between response and covariates with additional network data. Despite its wide range of applications in many areas, such as in social sciences and healthrelated research, the problem has not been well-studied in statistics so far. Previous methods either lack inference tools or rely on restrictive assumptions on social effects and usually assume that networks are observed without errors, which is unrealistic in many problems. This paper proposes a linear regression model with nonparametric network effects. The model does not assume that the relational data or network structure is exactly observed; thus, the method can be provably robust to a certain network perturbation level. A set of asymptotic inference results is established under a general requirement of the network observational errors, and the robustness of this method is studied in the specific setting when the errors come from random network models. We discover a phase-transition phenomenon of the inference validity concerning the network density when no prior knowledge of the network model is available while also showing a significant improvement achieved by knowing the network model. As a by-product of this analysis, we derive a rate-optimal concentration bound for random subspace projection that may be of independent interest. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to verify these theoretical results and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing work in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency under different data-generating models. The method is then applied to adolescent network data to study the gender and racial difference in social activities.},

Such analyses can be conducted using observed variables (e.g., a typical regression approach) or latent variables (e.g., a SEM approach), and choosing between these methods can be a more complex and consequential decision than researchers often realize. The present paper adds to the literature on mediation by examining the relative tradeoff between accuracy and precision in latent versus observed variable modeling. Whereas past work has shown that latent variable models tend to produce more accurate estimates, we demonstrate that observed variable models tend to produce more precise estimates, and examine this relative tradeoff both theoretically and empirically in a typical three-variable mediation model across varying levels of effect size and reliability. We discuss implications for social psychologists seeking to uncover mediating variables, and recommend practical approaches for maximizing both accuracy and precision in mediation analyses.},

Many of the limitations of such samples are well-known, but the issue of statistical dependence due to social network ties has not previously been addressed. We show that, along with anticonservative variance estimation, this can result in spurious associations due to network dependence. Using a statistical test that we adapted from one developed for spatial autocorrelation, we test for network dependence in several of the thousands of influential papers that have been published using FHS data. Results suggest that some of the many decades of research on coronary heart disease, other health outcomes, and peer influence using FHS data may suffer from spurious associations, error-prone point estimates, and anticonservative inference due to unacknowledged network dependence. These issues are not unique to the FHS; as researchers in psychology, medicine, and beyond grapple with replication failures, this unacknowledged source of invalid statistical inference should be part of the conversation.},

In this paper I discuss how social influence processes can be incorporated in the specification of W. Theories of social influence center around `communication' and `comparison'; it is discussed how these can be operationalized in a network analysis context. Starting from that, a series of operationalizations of W is discussed. Finally, statistical tests are presented that allow an analyst to test various specifications against one another or pick the best fitting model from a set of models. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Commonly used models of interference posit that treatments assigned to alters beyond a certain network distance from the ego have no effect on the ego's response. However, this assumption is violated in common models of social interactions. We propose a substantially weaker model of ``approximate neighborhood interference'' (ANI) under which treatments assigned to alters further from the ego have smaller, but potentially nonzero, effects on the ego's response. We formally verify that ANI holds for well-known models of social interactions. Under ANI, restrictions on the network topology, and asymptotics under which the network size increases, we prove that standard inverse-probability weighting estimators consistently estimate useful exposure effects and are approximately normal. For inference, we consider a network HAC variance estimator. Under a finite population model, we show that the estimator is biased but that the bias can be interpreted as the variance of unit-level exposure effects. This generalizes Neyman's well-known result on conservative variance estimation to settings with interference.},

We prove a central limit theorem for this embedding and demonstrate how it streamlines graph comparison, obviating the need for pairwise subspace alignments. The omnibus embedding achieves near-optimal inference accuracy when graphs arise from a common distribution and yet retains discriminatory power as a test procedure for the comparison of different graphs. Moreover, this joint embedding and the accompanying central limit theorem are important for answering multiscale graph inference questions, such as the identification of specific subgraphs or vertices responsible for similarity or difference across networks. We illustrate this with a pair of analyses of connectome data derived from dMRI and fMRI scans of human subjects. In particular, we show that this embedding allows the identification of specific brain regions associated with population-level differences. Finally, we sketch how the omnibus embedding can be used to address pressing open problems, both theoretical and practical, in multisample graph inference.},

Regularization is often employed to ensure the sparsity and smoothness of the coefficients in logistic regression. However, currently available methods fail to embed the network connectivity in regularized penalty functions. In this paper, a connected network-regularized logistic regression (CNet-RLR) model for feature selection considering the structural connectivity in a network was proposed. Mathematically, it was a convex optimization problem constrained by inequalities reflecting network connectivity. Considering the non-differentiability of Lasso penalty, we constructed an equivalent formulation of CNet-RLR by employing auxiliary variables. An interior-point algorithm was designed to efficiently achieve the solutions. Theoretically, we proved their grouping effect and oracle property and guaranteed algorithmic convergence. In both synthetic simulation data and real-world uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) cancer genomics data, we validated the CNet-RLR model is efficient to identify the connected-network-structured features that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers. In the comparison study, we also proved the proposed CNet-RLR model results in better classification performance and feature interpretability than the other regularized logistic regression (RLR) alternatives and another graph embedded feature selection model.},

In a TND study, individuals who experience symptoms and seek care are recruited and tested for the infectious disease which defines cases and controls. Despite TND's potential to reduce unobserved differences in healthcare seeking behavior (HSB) between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, it remains subject to various potential biases. First, residual confounding bias may remain due to unobserved HSB, occupation as healthcare worker, or previous infection history. Second, because selection into the TND sample is a common consequence of infection and HSB, collider stratification bias may exist when conditioning the analysis on testing, which further induces confounding by latent HSB. In this paper, we present a novel approach to identify and estimate vaccine effectiveness in the target population by carefully leveraging a pair of negative control exposure and outcome variables to account for potential hidden bias in TND studies.

One way of getting at such an understanding is to find out which parts of our DNA, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, affect particular intermediary processes such as gene expression. Naively, such associations can be identified using a simple statistical test on all paired combinations of genetic variants and gene transcripts. However, a wide variety of confounders lie hidden in the data, leading to both spurious associations and missed associations if not properly addressed. We present a statistical model that jointly corrects for two particular kinds of hidden structure\textemdash population structure (e.g., race, family-relatedness), and microarray expression artifacts (e.g., batch effects), when these confounders are unknown. Applying our method to both real and synthetic, human and mouse data, we demonstrate the need for such a joint correction of confounders, and also the disadvantages of other possible approaches based on those in the current literature. In particular, we show that our class of models has maximum power to detect eQTL on synthetic data, and has the best performance on a bronze standard applied to real data.

In some settings it may be reasonable to assume individuals can be partitioned into clusters such that there is no interference between individuals in different clusters, i.e., there is partial interference. In observational studies with partial interference, inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators have been proposed of different possible treatment effects. However, the validity of IPW estimators depends on the propensity score being known or correctly modeled. Alternatively, one can estimate the treatment effect using an outcome regression model. In this paper, we propose doubly robust (DR) estimators which utilize both models and are consistent and asymptotically normal if either model, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Empirical results are presented to demonstrate the DR property of the proposed estimators, as well as the efficiency gain of DR over IPW estimators when both models are correctly specified. The different estimators are illustrated using data from a study examining the effects of cholera vaccination in Bangladesh.},

However, such analyses of peer effects or contagion effects have come under criticism because homophily bias may compromise the causal statement. We develop a regressionbased approach which leverages a negative control exposure for identification and estimation of contagion effects on additive or multiplicative scales, in the presence of homophily bias. We apply our methods to evaluate the peer effect of obesity in Framingham Offspring Study.},

  abstract = {A social network comprises both actors and the social connections among them. Such connections reflect the dependence among social actors, which is essential for individuals' mental health and social development. In this article, we propose a mediation model with a social network as a mediator to investigate the potential mediation role of a social network. In the model, the dependence among actors is accounted for by a few mutually orthogonal latent dimensions which form a social space. The individuals' positions in such a latent social space are directly involved in the mediation process between an independent and dependent variable. After showing that all the latent dimensions are equivalent in terms of their relationship to the social network and the meaning of each dimension is arbitrary, we propose to measure the whole mediation effect of a network. Although individuals' positions in the latent space are not unique, we rigorously articulate that the proposed network mediation effect is still well defined. We use a Bayesian estimation method to estimate the model and evaluate its performance through an extensive simulation study under representative conditions. The usefulness of the network mediation model is demonstrated through an application to a college friendship network.},

The most important aspect of inferring causal effects from observational data is the handling of confounders, factors that affect both an intervention and its outcome. A carefully designed observational study attempts to measure all important confounders. However, even if one does not have direct access to all confounders, there may exist noisy and uncertain measurement of proxies for confounders. We build on recent advances in latent variable modeling to simultaneously estimate the unknown latent space summarizing the confounders and the causal effect. Our method is based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) which follow the causal structure of inference with proxies. We show our method is significantly more robust than existing methods, and matches the state-of-the-art on previous benchmarks focused on individual treatment effects.},

We find cautionary examples in a series of recent papers by Christakis and Fowler that advance statistical arguments for the transmission via social networks of various personal characteristics, including obesity, smoking cessation, happiness, and loneliness. Those papers also assert that such influence extends to three degrees of separation in social networks. We shall show that these conclusions do not follow from Christakis and Fowler's statistical analyses. In fact, their studies even provide some evidence against the existence of such transmission. The errors that we expose arose, in part, because the assumptions behind the statistical procedures used were insufficiently examined, not only by the authors, but also by the reviewers. Our examples are instructive because the practitioners are highly reputed, their results have received enormous popular attention, and the journals that published their studies are among the most respected in the world. An educational bonus emerges from the difficulty we report in getting our critique published. We discuss the relevance of this episode to understanding statistical literacy and the role of scientific review, as well as to reforming statistics education.},

Accumulating evidence has linked {$\epsilon$}4 carriership to abnormal structural brain changes across the adult lifespan. To better understand the underlying causal mechanisms, we investigated the extent to which the effect of the {$\epsilon$}4 allele on cognition is mediated by structural brain imaging markers in the population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility\textendash Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik). This study included 4527 participants (aged 76.3\,{$\pm$}\,5.4 at baseline) who underwent the brain magnetic resonance imaging assessment (of brain tissue volumes, white matter lesion volume, subcortical and cortical infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds) and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline. Causal mediation analysis was used to quantify the mediation of the {$\epsilon$}4 effect on cognition by these MRI markers, both individually and jointly. We observed that about 9\% of the total effect of {$\epsilon$}4 carriership on cognition was mediated by white matter lesion volume. This proportion increased to 25\% when total brain tissue volume was jointly considered with white matter lesion volume. In analyses separating {$\epsilon$}4 homozygotes from {$\epsilon$}4 heterozygotes, the effect on global cognition of specifically {$\epsilon$}4 homozygosity appeared to be partially mediated by cerebral microbleeds, particularly lobar microbleeds. There was no evidence of mediation of the {$\epsilon$}4 effect by cortical or subcortical infarcts. This study shows that the {$\epsilon$}4 effect on cognition is partly mediated by white matter lesion volume and total brain tissue volume. These findings suggest the joint role of cerebral small vessel disease and neurodegeneration in the {$\epsilon$}4-cognition relationship.},

  abstract = {Estimating individual treatment effects from data of randomized experiments is a critical task in causal inference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is usually made in causal inference. However, interference can introduce bias when the assigned treatment on one unit affects the potential outcomes of the neighboring units. This interference phenomenon is known as spillover effect in economics or peer effect in social science. Usually, in randomized experiments, or observational studies with interconnected units, one can only observe treatment responses under interference. Hence, the issue of how to estimate the superimposed causal effect and recover the individual treatment effect in the presence of interference becomes a challenging task. In this work, we study causal effect estimation under general network interference using Graph Neural Networks, which are powerful tools for capturing node and link dependencies in graphs. After deriving causal effect estimators, we further study intervention policy improvement on the graph under capacity constraint. We give policy regret bounds under network interference and treatment capacity constraint.},

We study identifiability of the model parameters, propose an inference procedure based on a variational expectation maximization algorithm as well as a model selection criterion to select for the number of groups. We carefully discuss our initialization strategy which plays an important role in the method and compare our procedure with existing ones on synthetic datasets.

We circumvent this issue by considering latent confounders whose distribution is learned through variational autoencoders adapted to missing values. They can be used either as a pre-processing step prior to causal inference but we also suggest to embed them in a multiple imputation strategy to take into account the variability due to missing values.

We show that, for common versions of those two network models, these estimates are so informative that controlling for estimated attributes allows for asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimation of social-influence effects in linear models. In particular, the bias shrinks at a rate which directly reflects how much information the network provides about the latent attributes. These are the first results on the consistent non-experimental estimation of social-influence effects in the presence of latent homophily, and we discuss the prospects for generalizing them.},

  abstract = {Summary             Path-specific effects constitute a broad class of mediated effects from an exposure to an outcome via one or more causal pathways along a set of intermediate variables. Most of the literature concerning estimation of mediated effects has focused on parametric models, with stringent assumptions regarding unmeasured confounding. We consider semiparametric inference of a path-specific effect when these assumptions are relaxed. In particular, we develop a suite of semiparametric estimators for the effect along a pathway through a mediator, but not through an exposure-induced confounder of that mediator. These estimators have different robustness properties, as each depends on different parts of the likelihood of the observed data. One estimator is locally semiparametric efficient and multiply robust. The latter property implies that machine learning can be used to estimate nuisance functions. We demonstrate these properties, as well as finite-sample properties of all the estimators, in a simulation study. We apply our method to an HIV study, in which we estimate the effect comparing two drug treatments on a patient's average log CD4 count mediated by the patient's level of adherence, but not by previous experience of toxicity, which is clearly affected by which treatment the patient is assigned to and may confound the effect of the patient's level of adherence on their virologic outcome.},

Discussion is given to the effect of experimental interventions on outcomes and behaviors and how these effects relate to the presence of social ties, the position of individuals within the network, and the underlying structure and properties of the network. The effects of such experimental interventions on changing the network structure itself and potential feedback between behaviors and network changes are also discussed. With observational data, correlations in behavior or outcomes between individuals with network ties may be due to social influence, homophily, or environmental confounding. With cross-sectional data these three sources of correlation cannot be distinguished. Methods employing longitudinal observational data that can help distinguish between social influence, homophily, and environmental confounding are described, along with their limitations. Proposals are made regarding future research directions and methodological developments that would help put causal inference on social networks on a firmer theoretical footing.},

Despite the methodological difficulties, a recent literature has emerged across several different disciplines that tries to estimate the causal effect of social capital. This paper reviews this recent empirical literature on social capital, paying close attention to the statistical and theoretical assumptions involved. Overall, there is evidence that genuine progress has been made in estimating the effect of social capital. The reviewed articles should provide useful examples for future research.},

Here we demonstrate how this "metadata" can be used to improve our analysis and understanding of network structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection in networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines a network and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead the method learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful information. The learned correlations are also of interest in their own right, allowing us to make predictions about the community membership of nodes whose network connections are unknown. We demonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and on real-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological, and technological domains.},

We take as inputs two familiar strategies (weighting and model-based prediction) and a simple way of combining them (weighted models), and show how we can generate a range of estimators with different modeling requirements and robustness properties. The primary goal is to help build intuitive appreciation for robust estimation that is conducive to sound practice. A second goal is to provide a ``menu'' of estimators that practitioners can choose from for the estimation of marginal natural (in)direct effects. The estimators generated from this exercise include some that coincide or are similar to existing estimators and others that have not previously appeared in the literature. We note several different ways to estimate the weights for cross-world weighting based on three expressions of the weighting function, including one that is novel; and show how to check the resulting covariate and mediator balance. We use a random continuous weights bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals, and also derive general asymptotic (sandwich) variance formulas for the estimators. The estimators are illustrated using data from an adolescent alcohol use prevention study.},

This two-study analysis focuses on self-employment in the working population and underlying gender differences in personality characteristics, thereby considering both single trait dimensions as well as a holistic, configural personality approach. Applying the fivefactor model of personality, Study 1, our main study, investigates mediation models in the prediction of self-employment status utilizing self-reported personality data from large-scaled longitudinal datasets collected in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., and Australia (total N = 28,762). Study 2 analyzes (observer-rated) Big Five data collected in 51 cultures (total N = 12,156) to take a more global perspective and to explore the pancultural universality of gender differences in entrepreneurial personality characteristics. Across the four countries investigated in Study 1, none of the major five dimension of personality turned out as a consistent and robust mediator. In contrast, the holistic, configural approach yielded consistent and robust mediation results. Across the four countries, males scored higher on an entrepreneurship-prone personality profile, which in turn predicted self-employment status. These results suggest that gender differences in the intra-individual configuration of personality traits contribute to the gender gap in entrepreneurship across the globe. With the restriction of limited representativeness, the data from Study 2 suggest that the gender difference in the entrepreneurship-prone personality profile (males score higher) is widespread across many cultures, but may not exist in all. The results are discussed with an emphasis on implications for research and practice, which a particular focus on the need for more complex models that incorporate the role of personality.},

We use causal diagrams to distinguish among three causal mechanisms that give rise to interference. The first causal mechanism by which interference can operate is a direct causal effect of one individual's treatment on another individual's outcome; we call this direct interference. Interference by contagion is present when one individual's outcome may affect the outcomes of other individuals with whom he comes into contact. Then giving treatment to the first individual could have an indirect effect on others through the treated individual's outcome. The third pathway by which interference may operate is allocational interference. Treatment in this case allocates individuals to groups; through interactions within a group, individuals may affect one another's outcomes in any number of ways. In many settings, more than one type of interference will be present simultaneously. The causal effects of interest differ according to which types of interference are present, as do the conditions under which causal effects are identifiable. Using causal diagrams for interference, we describe these differences, give criteria for the identification of important causal effects, and discuss applications to infectious diseases.},

However, recently there has been increasing interest in settings, such as social networks, where individuals may interact with one another such that treatments may spill over from the treated individual to their social contacts and outcomes may be contagious. Existing models proposed for causal inference using observational data from networks of interacting individuals have two major shortcomings. First, they often require a level of granularity in the data that is infeasible in practice to collect in most settings and, second, the models are high dimensional and often too big to fit to the available data. We illustrate and justify a parsimonious parameterization for network data with interference and contagion. Our parameterization corresponds to a particular family of graphical models known as chain graphs. We argue that, in some settings, chain graph models approximate the marginal distribution of a snapshot of a longitudinal data-generating process on interacting units. We illustrate the use of chain graphs for causal inference about collective decision making in social networks by using data from US Supreme Court decisions between 1994 and 2004 and in simulations.},

We propose new causal effects that are specifically of interest in social network settings, such as interventions on network ties and network structure.

While the conclusions of these studies may be correct, the methods rely on assumptions that are likely--and sometimes guaranteed to be--false, and therefore the evidence for the conclusions is often weaker than it seems. Developing methods that do not need to rely on implausible assumptions is an incredibly challenging and important open problem in statistics. Appropriate methods don't (yet!) exist, so researchers hoping to learn about contagion from observational social network data are sometimes faced with a dilemma: they can abandon their research program, or they can use inappropriate methods. This chapter will focus on the challenges and the open problems and will not weigh in on that dilemma, except to mention here that the most responsible way to use any statistical method, especially when it is well-known that the assumptions on which it rests do not hold, is with a healthy dose of skepticism, with honest acknowledgment and deep understanding of the limitations, and with copious caveats about how to interpret the results.},

In the modeling of international conflicts, for example, scholars hypothesize that membership in geopolitical coalitions shapes the decision to engage in militarized conflict. Such theories explain the ways in which nodal and dyadic characteristics affect the evolution of relational ties over time via their effects on group memberships. To aid the empirical testing of these arguments, we develop a dynamic model of network data by combining a hidden Markov model with a mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel that identifies latent groups underlying the network structure. Unlike existing models, we incorporate covariates that predict node membership in latent groups as well as the direct formation of edges between dyads. While prior substantive research often assumes the decision to engage in militarized conflict is independent across states and static over time, we demonstrate that conflict patterns are driven by states' evolving membership in geopolitical blocs. Changes in monadic covariates like democracy shift states between coalitions, generating heterogeneous effects on conflict over time and across states. The proposed methodology, which relies on a variational approximation to a collapsed posterior distribution as well as stochastic optimization for scalability, is implemented through an open-source software package.},

In this paper, we investigate how causal peer effects of traits and behaviors can be identified using genes (or other structurally isomorphic variables) as instrumental variables (IV) in a large set of data generating models with homophily and confounding. We use directed acyclic graphs to represent these models and employ multiple IV strategies and report three main identification results. First, using a single fixed gene (or allele) as an IV will generally fail to identify peer effects if the gene affects past values of the treatment. Second, multiple fixed genes/alleles, or, more promisingly, time-varying gene expression, can identify peer effects if we instrument exclusion violations as well as the focal treatment. Third, we show that IV identification of peer effects remains possible even under multiple complications often regarded as lethal for IV identification of intra-individual effects, such as pleiotropy on observables and unobservables, homophily on past phenotype, past and ongoing homophily on genotype, inter-phenotype peer effects, population stratification, gene expression that is endogenous to past phenotype and past gene expression, and others. We apply our identification results to estimating peer effects of body mass index (BMI) among friends and spouses in the Framingham Heart Study. Results suggest a positive causal peer effect of BMI between friends.},

Yet the classic causal inference framework is not directly applicable when the treatment and outcome variables are generated by spatio-temporal processes with an infinite number of possible event locations. We extend the potential outcomes framework to these settings by formulating the treatment point process as a stochastic intervention. Our causal estimands include the expected number of outcome events in a specified area under a particular stochastic treatment assignment strategy. We develop methodology that allows for arbitrary patterns of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. Using martingale theory, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as the number of time periods increases, even when the propensity score is estimated. We propose a sensitivity analysis for the possible existence of unmeasured confounders, and extend it to the Ha\textasciiacute jek estimator. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the estimators' finite sample performance. Finally, we use the proposed methods to estimate the effects of American airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq from February 2007 to July 2008. We find that increasing the average number of daily airstrikes for up to one month results in more insurgent attacks across Iraq and within Baghdad. We also find evidence that airstrikes can displace attacks from Baghdad to new locations up to 400 kilometers away.},

We present a simple, yet flexible asymptotic framework to derive the efficient influence function and the semiparametric efficiency lower bound for a family of network causal effects under partial interference. An important corollary of our results is that one of the existing estimators by Liu et al. (2019) is locally efficient. We also present other estimators that are efficient and discuss results on adaptive estimation. We conclude by using the efficient estimators to study the direct and spillover effects of conditional cash transfer programs in Colombia.},

  abstract = {The Spatial or Network Autoregressive model (SAR, NAM) is popular for modeling the influence network connected neighbors exert on the outcome of individuals. However, many authors have noted that the causal network influence or contagion cannot be identified from observational data due to the presence of homophily. We propose a latent homophily-adjusted spatial autoregressive model for networked responses to identify the causal contagion and contextual effects. The latent homophily is estimated from the spectral embedding of the network's adjacency matrix. Separately, we develop maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters of the SAR model correcting for measurement error when covariates are measured with error. We show that the bias corrected MLE are consistent and derive its asymptotic limiting distribution. We propose to estimate network influence using the bias corrected MLE in a SAR model with the estimated latent homophily added as a covariate. Our simulations show that the methods perform well in finite sample. We apply our methodology to a data-set of female criminal offenders in a therapeutic community (TC) for substance abuse and criminal behavior. We provide causal estimates of network influence on graduation from TC and re-incarceration after accounting for latent homophily.},

However, the more general case of mixed membership for directed network remains a challenge. Here, we propose an interpretable and identifiable model: directed mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (DiMMSB for short) for directed mixed membership networks. DiMMSB allows that row nodes and column nodes of the adjacency matrix can be different and these nodes may have distinct community structure in a directed network. We also develop an efficient spectral algorithm called DiSP designed based on simplex structures inherent in the left and right singular vectors of the population adjacency matrix to estimate the mixed memberships for both row nodes and column nodes in a directed network. We show that DiSP is asymptotically consistent under mild conditions by providing error bounds for the inferred membership vectors of each row node and each column node using delicate spectral analysis. We demonstrate the advantages of DiSP with applications to simulated directed mixed membership network, the directed Political blogs network and the Papers Citation network.},

To enable feasible inference, many previous works assume the ``exchangeability'' of interfering units, under which the effect of interference is captured by the number or ratio of treated neighbors. However, in many applications with distinctive units, interference is heterogeneous. In this paper, we focus on the partial interference setting, and restrict units to be exchangeable conditional on observable characteristics. Under this framework, we propose generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators for general causal estimands that include direct treatment effects and spillover effects. We show that they are consistent, asymptotically normal, semiparametric efficient, and robust to heterogeneous interference as well as model misspecifications. We also apply our method to the Add Health dataset and find that smoking behavior exhibits interference on academic outcomes.},

Drawing from a systematic review of 536 mediation papers published in five recent years (2016\textendash 2020) in top tier tourism and hospitality journals, the findings revealed several critical issues in different mediation analysis steps, including hypothesis development, mediation assessment and interpretation of results.

Spatial casual inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality, and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies, and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate. Code to implement many of the methods using the popular Bayesian software OpenBUGS is provided.},

We investigate this gap between theory and empirical results with analytical considerations and extensive experiments under multiple synthetic and real-world data sets, using the causal effect variational autoencoder (CEVAE) as a case study. While CEVAE seems to work reliably under some simple scenarios, it does not estimate the causal effect correctly with a misspecified latent variable or a complex data distribution, as opposed to its original motivation. Hence, our results show that more attention should be paid to ensuring the correctness of causal estimates with deep latent variable models.},

  abstract = {Psychologists developed Multiple Factor Analysis to decompose multivariate data into a small number of interpretable factors without any a priori knowledge about those factors [Thurstone, 1935]. In this form of factor analysis, the Varimax ``factor rotation'' is a key step to make the factors interpretable [Kaiser, 1958]. Charles Spearman and many others objected to factor rotations because the factors seem to be rotationally invariant [Thurstone, 1947, Anderson and Rubin, 1956]. These objections are still reported in all contemporary multivariate statistics textbooks. This is an engima because this vintage form of factor analysis has survived and is widely popular because, empirically, the factor rotation often makes the factors easier to interpret. We argue that the rotation makes the factors easier to interpret because, in fact, the Varimax factor rotation performs statistical inference. We show that Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with the Varimax rotation provides a unified spectral estimation strategy for a broad class of modern factor models, including the Stochastic Blockmodel and a natural variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (i.e., ``topic modeling''). In addition, we show that Thurstone's widely employed sparsity diagnostics implicitly assess a key ``leptokurtic'' condition that makes the rotation statistically identifiable in these models. Taken together, this shows that the know-how of Vintage Factor Analysis performs statistical inference, reversing nearly a century of statistical thinking on the topic. With a sparse eigensolver, PCA with Varimax is both fast and stable. Combined with Thurstone's straightforward diagnostics, this vintage approach is suitable for a wide array of modern applications.},

This paper proposes a generalisation of the latent position network model known as the random dot product graph, to allow interpretation of those vector representations as latent position estimates. The generalisation is needed to model heterophilic connectivity (e.g., `opposites attract') and to cope with negative eigenvalues more generally. We show that, whether the adjacency or normalised Laplacian matrix is used, spectral embedding produces uniformly consistent latent position estimates with asymptotically Gaussian error (up to identifiability). The standard and mixed membership stochastic block models are special cases in which the latent positions take only K distinct vector values, representing communities, or live in the (K - 1)-simplex with those vertices, respectively. Under the stochastic block model, our theory suggests spectral clustering using a Gaussian mixture model (rather than K-means) and, under mixed membership, fitting the minimum volume enclosing simplex, existing recommendations previously only supported under non-negative-definite assumptions. Empirical improvements in link prediction (over the random dot product graph), and the potential to uncover richer latent structure (than posited under the standard or mixed membership stochastic block models) are demonstrated in a cyber-security example.},

Natural direct and indirect effects are not generally point-identifiable in the presence of a treatment-induced confounder, however they may still be identified if one is willing to assume monotonicity between a treatment and the treatment-induced confounder. We argue that this assumption may be reasonable in the relatively common encouragement-design trial setting where intervention is randomized treatment assignment and the treatment-induced confounder is whether or not treatment was actually taken/adhered to. We develop efficiency theory for the natural direct and indirect effects under this monotonicity assumption, and use it to propose a nonparametric, multiply robust estimator.

  abstract = {The Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) model is a wide used estimation procedure in econometrics, insurance and finance, where very often, the regression model contains more than one equation. Unknown parameters, regression coefficients and covariances among the errors terms, are estimated using algorithms based on Generalized Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood, and the method, as a whole, is very sensitive to outliers. To overcome this problem M-estimators and S-estimators are proposed in the literature together with fast algorithms. However, these procedures are only able to cope with rowwise outliers in the error terms, while their performance becomes very poor in the presence of cell-wise outliers and as the number of equations increases. A new robust approach is proposed which is able to perform well under both contamination types as well as it is fast to compute. Illustrations based on Monte Carlo simulations and a real data example are provided.},

The inferential target is a generalization of the average treatment effect estimand that marginalizes over potential spillover effects. We show that estimators commonly used to estimate treatment effects under no interference are consistent for the generalized estimand for several common experimental designs under limited but otherwise arbitrary and unknown interference. The rates of convergence depend on the rate at which the amount of interference grows and the degree to which it aligns with dependencies in treatment assignment. Importantly for practitioners, the results imply that if one erroneously assumes that units do not interfere in a setting with limited, or even moderate, interference, standard estimators are nevertheless likely to be close to an average treatment effect if the sample is sufficiently large. Conventional confidence statements may, however, not be accurate.},

We show that, generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular we demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects, and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and their choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. We also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.},

  abstract = {The most promising class of statistical models for expressing structural properties of social networks observed at one moment in time is the class of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p* models. The strong point of these models is that they can represent a variety of structural tendencies, such as transitivity, that define complicated dependence patterns not easily modeled by more basic probability models. Recently, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have been developed that produce approximate maximum likelihood estimators. Applying these models in their traditional specification to observed network data often has led to problems, however, which can be traced back to the fact that important parts of the parameter space correspond to nearly degenerate distributions, which may lead to convergence problems of estimation algorithms, and a poor fit to empirical data.             This paper proposes new specifications of exponential random graph models. These specifications represent structural properties such as transitivity and heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated graph statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts. Three kinds of statistics are proposed: geometrically weighted degree distributions, alternating k-triangles, and alternating independent two-paths. Examples are presented both of modeling graphs and digraphs, in which the new specifications lead to much better results than the earlier existing specifications of the ERGM. It is concluded that the new specifications increase the range and applicability of the ERGM as a tool for the statistical analysis of social networks.},

Correlations among mediators are commonly observed in modern data analysis; examples include the activated voxels within connected regions in brain image data, regulatory signals driven by gene networks in genome data and correlated exposure data from the same source. When correlations are present among active mediators, mediation analysis that fails to account for such correlation can be sub-optimal and may lead to a loss of power in identifying active mediators. Building upon a recent high-dimensional mediation analysis framework, we propose two Bayesian hierarchical models, one with a Gaussian mixture prior that enables correlated mediator selection and the other with a Potts mixture prior that accounts for the correlation among active mediators in mediation analysis. We develop efficient sampling algorithms for both methods. Various simulations demonstrate that our methods enable effective identification of correlated active mediators, which could be missed by using existing methods that assume prior independence among active mediators. The proposed methods are applied to the LIFECODES birth cohort and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and identified new active mediators with important biological implications.},

This requires identification of so-called path-specific effects. These express how a change in exposure affects those intermediate variables (along certain pathways), and how the resulting changes in those variables in turn affect the outcome (along subsequent pathways). However, unlike identification of total effects, adjustment for confounding is insufficient for identification of path-specific effects because their magnitude is also determined by the extent to which individuals who experience large exposure effects on the mediator, tend to experience relatively small or large mediator effects on the outcome. This chapter therefore provides an accessible review of identification strategies under general nonparametric structural equation models (with possibly unmeasured variables), which rule out certain such dependencies. In particular, it is shown which path-specific effects can be identified under such models, and how this can be done.},

One popular model for network analysis is the exchangeable graph model (ExGM) characterized by a two-dimensional function known as a graphon. Estimating an underlying graphon becomes the key of such analysis. Several nonparametric estimation methods have been proposed, and some are provably consistent. However, if certain useful features of the nodes (e.g., age and schools in social network context) are available, none of these methods was designed to incorporate this source of information to help with the estimation. This paper develops a consistent graphon estimation method that integrates the information from both the adjacency matrix itself and node features. We show that properly leveraging the features can improve the estimation. A cross-validation method is proposed to automatically select the tuning parameter of the method.},

For example, how soon will a person start playing a game given that his/her friends like it? Studying social network dependence is an emerging research area. In this work, we propose a novel latent spatial autocorrelation Cox model to study social network dependence with time-to-event data. The proposed model introduces a latent indicator to characterize whether a person's survival time might be affected by his or her friends' features. We first propose a score-type test for detecting the existence of social network dependence. If it exists, we further develop an EM-type algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The performance of the proposed test and estimators are illustrated by simulation studies and an application to a time-to-event dataset about playing a popular mobile game from one of the largest online social network platforms.

From a causal inference perspective, the typical assumption of no interference becomes untenable in such experiments. In many problems, however, the patterns of interference may be informed by the observation of network connections among the units of analysis. Here, we develop elements of optimal estimation theory for causal effects leveraging an observed network, by assuming that the potential outcomes of an individual depend only on the individual's treatment and on the treatment of the neighbors. We propose a collection of exclusion restrictions on the potential outcomes, and show how subsets of these restrictions lead to various parameterizations. Considering the class of linear unbiased estimators of the average direct treatment effect, we derive conditions on the design that lead to the existence of unbiased estimators, and offer analytical insights on the weights that lead to minimum integrated variance estimators. We illustrate the improved performance of these estimators when compared to more standard biased and unbiased estimators, using simulations.},

Due to lack of methodology, however, social networks have not been modeled as mediators. We present a new framework for modeling social networks as mediators in which a social network model is embedded into a mediation model and both models are estimated simultaneously. As a proof of concept, we introduce a new network model for mediation, applicable for interventions that affect subgroup structure. We provide a small simulation study to demonstrate the feasibility of this model and explore some potential operating characteristics.

In many scientific disciplines, the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal effects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally affects the outcome. Causal mediation analysis is frequently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation effects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the standard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under different experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. We also implement a statistical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice. Finally, the package also offers a methodology for assessing causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance, a common problem in randomized trials.},

We assume that the network is known and measures similarity, and our goal is to learn about an attribute associated with its vertices. Classical regression methods are not immediately applicable to this setting, as we would like our model to incorporate information from both network structure and pertinent covariates. Our proposed model consists of a generalized linear model with vertex indexed predictors and a basis expansion of their coefficients, allowing the coefficients to vary over the network. We employ a regularization procedure, cast as a prior distribution on the regression coefficients under a Bayesian setup, so that the predicted responses vary smoothly according to the topology of the network. We motivate the need for this model by examining occurrences of residential burglary in Boston, Massachusetts. Noting that crime rates are not spatially homogeneous, and that the rates appear to vary sharply across regions in the city, we construct a hierarchical model that addresses these issues and gives insight into spatial patterns of crime occurrences. Furthermore, we examine efficient expectation-maximization fitting algorithms and provide computationally-friendly methods for eliciting hyperprior parameters.},

When adjustment is made for socioeconomic status early in a person's life, we discuss under what contexts the regression coefficients for race can be interpreted as corresponding to the extent to which a racial inequality would remain if various socioeconomic distributions early in life across racial groups could be equalized. When adjustment is also made for adult socioeconomic status, we note how the overall racial inequality can be decomposed into the portion that would be eliminated by equalizing adult socioeconomic status across racial groups and the portion of the inequality that would remain even if adult socioeconomic status across racial groups were equalized. We also discuss a stronger interpretation of the ``effect of race'' (stronger in terms of assumptions) involving the joint effects of race-associated physical phenotype (e.g. skin color), parental physical phenotype, genetic background and cultural context when such variables are thought to be hypothetically manipulable and if adequate control for confounding were possible. We discuss some of the challenges with such an interpretation. Further discussion is given as to how the use of selected populations in examining racial disparities can additionally complicate the interpretation of the effects.},

Whereas prior results give bounds that contain the null hypothesis of no direct effect, the results presented here will in many instances yield bounds that do not contain the null hypothesis of no direct effect. For contexts in which a set of variables intercepts all paths between a treatment and an outcome, it is possible to provide a definition for a controlled mediated effect. We discuss the identification of these controlled mediated effects; the bounds for controlled direct effects are applicable also to controlled mediated effects.

Two analytic approaches, one based on regression and one based on weighting are proposed to estimate the effect mediated through multiple mediators and the effects through other pathways. The approaches proposed here accommodate exposure-mediator interactions and, to a certain extent, mediator-mediator interactions as well. The methods handle binary or continuous mediators and binary, continuous or count outcomes. When the mediators affect one another, the strategy of trying to assess direct and indirect effects one mediator at a time will in general fail; the approach given in this paper can still be used. A characterization is moreover given as to when the sum of the mediated effects for multiple mediators considered separately will be equal to the mediated effect of all of the mediators considered jointly.

  abstract = {Factor analysis is often used to assess whether a single univariate latent variable is sufficient to explain most of the covariance among a set of indicators for some underlying construct. When evidence suggests that a single factor is adequate, research often proceeds by using a univariate summary of the indicators in subsequent research. Implicit in such practices is the assumption that it is the underlying latent, rather than the indicators, that is causally efficacious. The assumption that the indicators do not have effects on anything subsequent, and that they are themselves only affected by antecedents through the underlying latent is a strong assumption, effectively imposing a structural interpretation on the latent factor model. In this paper, we show that this structural assumption has empirically testable implications, even though the latent is unobserved. We develop a statistical test to potentially reject the structural interpretation of a latent factor model. We apply this test to data concerning associations between the Satisfactionwith-Life-Scale and subsequent all-cause mortality, which provides strong evidence against a structural interpretation for a univariate latent underlying the scale. Discussion is given to the implications of this result for the development, evaluation, and use of measures related to latent factor models.},

Traditional approaches build on standard regression models for the outcome and mediator, but easily result in difficult-to-interpret or difficult-to-report results when some of these models involve non-linearities. In this article, we overcome this via a general class of so-called natural effect models, which directly parameterize the (natural) direct and indirect effects of interest. We propose flexible estimation strategies for the direct and indirect effect parameters indexing these models, that are easy to perform with standard statistical software: one based on regression mean imputation and one based on doubly robust imputation. We give a theoretical discussion of the properties of these estimation strategies. We moreover assess their finite-sample performance through a simulation study, and through the analysis of the WHO-LARES study on the association between residence in a damp and moldy dwelling and the risk of depression.},

  abstract = {For decades, social scientists have been trying to answer causal questions about the effectiveness of certain programs or policies. The conventional methodology for answering such causal questions relies on the ``no interference between different units'' assumption; that is, a unit's outcome depends solely on the treatment that the unit is assigned to (or exposed to) and does not depend on the treatment assignment (or exposure) of other units in the population. However, this assumption is likely to be violated in spatial settings because of various spillover, diffusion, and displacement effects. In this paper, we present a case study evaluating the causal effects of Chicago's community policing program (a community-wide intervention) on neighborhoods' crime rates. We use semiannual crime data from Chicago to evaluate (1) whether community policing is more effective at decreasing rates of reported personal crime when implemented everywhere versus nowhere in a city; (2) whether community policing is effective if implemented in a single local area, holding constant policing in adjacent areas; (3) whether implementing community policing in surrounding areas affects crime in a focal area; and (4) whether community policing's impact on crime in surrounding areas depends on whether community policing is also implemented in the focal area. To answer these questions, we relax the no-interference assumption. Our approach allows the potential outcomes in any local area to depend on a function of the treatment assignments in all other units. We define causal effects and evaluate assumptions that make the framework tractable within the framework of a generalized linear model with spatially auto-correlated random effects.},

A few basic applications are covered in this text, particularly for the problem of estimating covariance matrices in statistics and for validating probabilistic constructions of measurement matrices in compressed sensing.

However, these methods can only measure whether the information exists, not whether it is actually used by the model. We propose a methodology grounded in the theory of causal mediation analysis for interpreting which parts of a model are causally implicated in its behavior. The approach enables us to analyze the mechanisms that facilitate the flow of information from input to output through various model components, known as mediators. As a case study, we apply this methodology to analyzing gender bias in pre-trained Transformer language models. We study the role of individual neurons and attention heads in mediating gender bias across three datasets designed to gauge a model's sensitivity to gender bias. Our mediation analysis reveals that gender bias effects are concentrated in specific components of the model that may exhibit highly specialized behavior.},

Causal analyses that leverage this type of data, termed ordinal non-numeric, require careful treatment, as much of the classical potential outcomes literature is concerned with estimation and hypothesis testing for outcomes whose relative magnitudes are well defined. Here, we propose a class of finite population causal estimands that depend on conditional distributions of the potential outcomes, and provide an interpretable summary of causal effects when no scale is available. We formulate a relaxation of the Fisherian sharp null hypothesis of constant effect that accommodates the scale-free nature of ordinal non-numeric data. We develop a Bayesian procedure to estimate the proposed causal estimands that leverages the rank likelihood. We illustrate these methods with an application to educational outcomes in the General Social Survey.},

Various frequentist approaches have been suggested for the detection of ``clusters'' within a hypothesis testing framework. Unfortunately, these suffer from a number of drawbacks including the difficulty in specifying a p-value threshold at which to call significance, the inherent multiplicity problem, and the possibility of multiple clusters. In this paper, we suggest a Bayesian approach to detecting ``areas of clustering'' in which the study region is partitioned into, possibly multiple, ``zones'' within which the risk is either at a null, or non-null, level. Computation is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo, tuned to the model that we develop. The method is applied to leukemia data in upstate New York.},

In this paper, we propose a simple and intuitive regularization approach to integrate causal knowledge during model training and build a robust and fair model by emphasizing causal features and de-emphasizing spurious features. Specifically, we first manually identify causal and spurious features with principles inspired from the counterfactual framework of causal inference. Then, we propose a regularization approach to penalize causal and spurious features separately. By adjusting the strength of the penalty for each type of feature, we build a predictive model that relies more on causal features and less on non-causal features. We conduct experiments to evaluate model robustness and fairness on three datasets with multiple metrics. Empirical results show that the new models built with causal awareness significantly improve model robustness with respect to counterfactual texts and model fairness with respect to sensitive attributes.},

Despite the various estimation methods and statistical routines being developed, a unified approach for effect estimation under different effect decomposition scenarios is still needed for epidemiologic research. G-computation offers such unification and has been used for total effect and joint controlled direct effect estimation settings, involving different types of exposure and outcome variables. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of parametric g-computation in estimating various components of the total effect, including (i) natural direct and indirect effects, (ii) standard and stochastic controlled direct effects, and (iii) reference and mediated interaction effects, using Monte Carlo simulations in standard statistical software. For each study subject, we estimated their nested potential outcomes corresponding to the (mediated) effects of an intervention on the exposure wherein the mediator was allowed to attain the value it would have under a possible counterfactual exposure intervention, under a pre-specified distribution of the mediator independent of any causes, or under a fixed controlled value. A final regression of the potential outcome on the exposure intervention variable was used to compute point estimates and bootstrap was used to obtain confidence intervals. Through contrasting different potential outcomes, this analytical framework provides an intuitive way of estimating effects under the recently introduced 3- and 4- way effect decomposition. This framework can be extended to complex multivariable and longitudinal mediation settings.},

This methodology allows for effective integration, informative visualization, and prediction of social networks and high dimensional attribute measurements. Using APLSM, we explore the inner workings of the French financial elites based on their social networks and their career, political views, and social status.

The permutation test, on the significance of a regression parameter, can improve the accuracy of the hypothesis decision. In this study, we conducted a simulation to compare the performance of the permutation test and the asymptotic likelihood ratio test under various conditions. The simulation results confirm the advantages of the permutation test as expected.},

The key innovations are a hierarchical Bayesian model, Gaussian processes with structured latent confounders (GP-SLC), and a Monte Carlo inference algorithm for this model based on elliptical slice sampling. GP-SLC provides principled Bayesian uncertainty estimates of individual treatment effect with minimal assumptions about the functional forms relating confounders, covariates, treatment, and outcome.

Capitalizing on a large neuroimaging cohort (n = 1, 051), we demonstrate that MSNR recapitulates interpretable and statistically significant connectivity patterns associated with brain development, sex differences, and motion-related artifacts. Compared to single-scale methods, MSNR achieves a balance between prediction performance and model complexity, with improved interpretability. Together, by jointly exploiting both edge- and community-level information, MSNR has the potential to yield novel insights into brain-behavior relationships.},

We develop a minimax lower bound for estimating the latent positions, and show that posterior spectral embedding achieves this lower bound in the following two senses: it both results in a minimax-optimal posterior contraction rate and yields a point estimator achieving the minimax risk asymptotically. The convergence results are subsequently applied to clustering in stochastic block models with positive semidefinite block probability matrices, strengthening an existing result concerning the number of misclustered vertices. We also study a spectral-based Gaussian spectral embedding as a natural Bayesian analogue of adjacency spectral embedding, but the resulting posterior contraction rate is suboptimal by an extra logarithmic factor. The practical performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through extensive synthetic examples and the analysis of Wikipedia graph data.},

However, the main challenge of gene expression data analysis is high dimensionality, and microarray is characterised by few number of samples with large number of genes. To overcome this problem, a variety of penalised Cox proportional hazard models have been proposed. We introduce a novel network regularised Cox proportional hazard model and a novel multiplex network model to measure the disease comorbidities and to predict survival of the cancer patient. Our methods are applied to analyse seven microarray cancer gene expression datasets: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer and osteosarcoma. Firstly, we applied a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of original gene expression data. Secondly, we applied a network regularised Cox regression model on the reduced gene expression datasets. By using normalised mutual information method and multiplex network model, we predict the comorbidities for the liver cancer based on the integration of diverse set of omics and clinical data, and we find the diseasome associations (disease\textendash gene association) among different cancers based on the identified common significant genes. Finally, we evaluated the precision of the approach with respect to the accuracy of survival prediction using ROC curves. We report that colon cancer, liver cancer and renal cancer share the CXCL5 gene, and breast cancer, ovarian cancer and renal cancer share the CCND2 gene. Our methods are useful to predict survival of the patient and disease comorbidities more accurately and helpful for improvement of the care of patients with comorbidity.

In many instances, covariates and networks individually only give a partial view of the cluster structure. One needs to jointly infer the full cluster structure by considering both. In statistics, an emerging body of work has been focused on combining information from both the edges in the network and the node covariates to infer community memberships. However, so far the theoretical guarantees have been established in the dense regime, where the network can lead to perfect clustering under a broad parameter regime, and hence the role of covariates is often not clear. In this paper, we examine sparse networks in conjunction with finite dimensional sub-gaussian mixtures as covariates under moderate separation conditions. In this setting each individual source can only cluster a non-vanishing fraction of nodes correctly. We propose a simple optimization framework which provably improves clustering accuracy when the two sources carry partial information about the cluster memberships, and hence perform poorly on their own. Our optimization problem can be solved using scalable convex optimization algorithms. Using a variety of simulated and real data examples, we show that the proposed method outperforms other existing methodology.},

In this article, we rigorously study a directed network model that captures the former via node-specific parameterization and the latter by incorporating covariates. In particular, this model quantifies the extent of heterogeneity in terms of outgoingness and incomingness of each node by different parameters, thus allowing the number of heterogeneity parameters to be twice the number of nodes. We study the maximum likelihood estimation of the model and establish the uniform consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. Numerical studies demonstrate our theoretical findings and two data analyses confirm the usefulness of our model. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools that allow us to uncover organizational principles in networks. When detecting communities, there are two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches. Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by finding relevant node attributes for each community.},

However, experimental settings, such as social networks, where users are interacting and influencing one another, may violate conventional assumptions of no interference for credible causal inference. Existing solutions to the network setting include accounting for the fraction or count of treated neighbors in a user's network, yet most current methods do not account for the local network structure beyond simply counting the number of neighbors. Our study provides an approach that accounts for both the local structure in a user's social network via motifs as well as the treatment assignment conditions of neighbors. We propose a two-part approach. We first introduce and employ ``causal network motifs'', which are network motifs that characterize the assignment conditions in local ego networks; and then we propose a tree-based algorithm for identifying different network interference conditions and estimating their average potential outcomes. Our approach can account for social network theories, such as structural diversity and echo chambers, and also can help specify network interference conditions that are suitable to each experiment. We test our method on a synthetic network setting and on a real-world experiment on a large-scale network, which highlight how accounting for local structures can better account for different interference patterns in networks.},

However, there are node features in real networks, such as gender types in social networks, feeding behavior in ecological networks, and location on e-trading networks, that can be further leveraged with the network structure to attain more accurate community detection methods. We propose a novel probabilistic graphical model to detect communities by taking into account both network structure and nodes' features. The proposed approach learns the relevant features of communities through a generative probabilistic model without any prior assumption on the communities. Furthermore, the model is capable of determining the strength of node features and structural elements of the networks on shaping the communities.

  abstract = {Mediation analysis investigates the intermediate mechanism through which an exposure exerts its influence on the outcome of interest. Mediation analysis is becoming increasingly popular in high-throughput genomics studies where a common goal is to identify molecular-level traits, such as gene expression or methylation, which actively mediate the genetic or environmental effects on the outcome. Mediation analysis in genomics studies is particularly challenging, however, thanks to the large number of potential mediators measured in these studies as well as the composite null nature of the mediation effect hypothesis. Indeed, while the standard univariate and multivariate mediation methods have been wellestablished for analyzing one or multiple mediators, they are not well-suited for genomics studies with a large number of mediators and often yield conservative p-values and limited power. Consequently, over the past few years many new high-dimensional mediation methods have been developed for analyzing the large number of potential mediators collected in high-throughput genomics studies. In this work, we present a thorough review of these important recent methodological advances in high-dimensional mediation analysis. Specifically, we describe in detail more than ten high-dimensional mediation methods, focusing on their motivations, basic modeling ideas, specific modeling assumptions, practical successes, methodological limitations, as well as future directions. We hope our review will serve as a useful guidance for statisticians and computational biologists who develop methods of highdimensional mediation analysis as well as for analysts who apply mediation methods to highthroughput genomics studies.},

We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when the network is not too sparse and the overlaps between communities are not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection.},

We find evidence of both (i) candidate-centered structure, where citizens primarily comment on the wall of one candidate and (ii) issue-centered structure (i.e. on political topics), where citizens' attention and expression is primarily directed towards a specific set of issues (e.g. economics, immigration, etc). To identify issue-centered structure, we develop pairGraphText, to analyze a network with high-dimensional features on the interactions (i.e. text). This technique scales to hundreds of thousands of nodes and thousands of unique words. In the Facebook data, spectral clustering without the contextualizing text information finds a mixture of (i) candidate and (ii) issue clusters. The contextualized information with text data helps to separate these two structures. We conclude by showing that the novel methodology is consistent under a statistical model.},

However, the transformed mediator PCs, which are linear combinations of original mediators, are difficult to interpret. In this study, we propose a sparse high-dimensional mediation analysis approach by adopting the sparse PCA method introduced by Zou and others (2006) to the mediation setting.

Numerous approaches for community detection have been proposed in literature, from ad-hoc algorithms to systematic model-based approaches. The large number of available methods leads to a fundamental question: whether a certain method can provide consistent estimates of community labels. The stochastic blockmodel (SBM) and its variants provide a convenient framework for the study of such problems. This article is a survey on the recent theoretical advances of community detection. The authors review a number of community detection methods and their theoretical properties, including graph cut methods, profile likelihoods, the pseudo-likelihood method, the variational method, belief propagation, spectral clustering, and semidefinite relaxations of the SBM. The authors also briefly discuss other research topics in community detection such as robust community detection, community detection with nodal covariates and model selection, as well as suggest a few possible directions for future research.},

  abstract = {In many causal inference problems, one is interested in the direct causal effect of an exposure on an outcome of interest that is not mediated by certain intermediate variables. Robins and Greenland (1992) and Pearl (2001) formalized the definition of two types of direct effects (natural and controlled) under the counterfactual framework. The efficient scores (under a nonparametric model) for the various natural effect parameters and their general robustness conditions, as well as an estimating equation based estimator using the efficient score, are provided in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2011b). In this article, we apply the targeted maximum likelihood framework of van der Laan and Rubin (2006) and van der Laan and Rose (2011) to construct a semiparametric efficient, multiply robust, substitution estimator for the natural direct effect which satisfies the efficient score equation derived in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2011b). We note that the robustness conditions in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2011b) may be weakened, thereby placing less reliance on the estimation of the mediator density. More precisely, the proposed estimator is asymptotically unbiased if either one of the following holds: i) the conditional mean outcome given exposure, mediator, and confounders, and the mediated mean outcome difference are consistently estimated; (ii) the exposure mechanism given confounders, and the conditional mean outcome are consistently estimated; or (iii) the exposure mechanism and the mediator density, or the exposure mechanism and the conditional distribution of the exposure given confounders and mediator, are consistently estimated. If all three conditions hold, then the effect estimate is asymptotically efficient. Extensions to the natural indirect effect are also discussed.},

To model both the interindividual dependence and within-individual dynamic correlation, we propose a network functional varying coefficient (NFVC) model. The response of each individual is characterized by a linear combination of responses from its connected nodes and its exogenous covariates. All the model coefficients are allowed to be time dependent. The NFVC model adds to the richness of both the classical network autoregression model and the functional regression models. To overcome the complexity caused by the network interdependence, we devise a special nonparametric least-squarestype estimator, which is feasible when the responses are observed at irregular time points for different individuals. The estimator takes advantage of the sparsity of the network structure to reduce the computational burden. To further conduct the functional principal component analysis, a novel within-individual covariance function estimation method is proposed and studied. Theoretical properties of our estimators, which involve techniques related to empirical processes, nonparametrics, functional data analysis and various concentration inequalities, are analyzed. We analyze a social network dataset to illustrate the powerfulness of the proposed procedure.},
